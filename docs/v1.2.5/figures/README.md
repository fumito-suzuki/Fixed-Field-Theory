![tfiber_twave_structure](docs/v1.2.5/figures/tfiber_twave_structure.JPG "T-fiber T-wave Structure")

A visual anchor for the distinction between
the stable T-fiber core (real structure)
and the surrounding T-wave interference.

This figure is not a physical illustration.
It fixes the *viewing angle* used throughout FFT
to separate substance (Ψ) from appearance (ψ).
