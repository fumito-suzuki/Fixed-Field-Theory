# Appendix β+1  
## Numerical Consistency of the Cosmological Constant Λ  
### from χδ Geometry in Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

This appendix evaluates whether the FFT prediction

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
=
\alpha \left\langle
\|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2
\right\rangle_{\mathrm{cosmic}}
$$

can naturally reproduce the observed value of the cosmological constant

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}
\approx 10^{-52}\;\mathrm{m^{-2}}.
$$

Appendix Z+5 established a purely geometric origin of Λ from ψ-divergence.
Here we analyze **whether the magnitude** of this Λ is consistent with the
structure of χδ geometry at cosmic scales.

The conclusion of this appendix is that **FFT predicts a positive and extremely
small Λ without fine-tuning**, provided the large-scale χδ gradients evolve
smoothly with cosmic expansion.

# β+1.1 Scaling of χ and δ on Cosmological Length Scales

We begin with

$$
\psi = \chi\delta,
\qquad 
\Lambda
=
\alpha \left\langle
\|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2
\right\rangle.
$$

On scales above ∼100 Mpc, the universe is statistically homogeneous.
Thus we assume:

1. **χ** varies only on large curvature scales  
2. **δ** is dominated by smoothed C-wave interference (CMB-level fluctuations)  
3. Cross-terms $\nabla\chi\cdot\nabla\delta$ are suppressed by cosmic averaging

Decomposing:

$$
\nabla(\chi\delta)
=
\delta\nabla\chi + \chi\nabla\delta,
$$

we obtain:

$$
\Lambda
\;\approx\;
\alpha
\left(
\delta_0^2 \langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle
\;+\;
\chi_0^2 \langle\|\nabla\delta\|^2\rangle
\right).
$$

The first term is **curvature-driven**,  
the second **interference-driven**.

FFT identifies the curvature-driven term as the dominant one in the
late universe, because δ is nearly flat on gigaparsec scales.

Thus the effective expression becomes:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\approx
\alpha\,\delta_0^2\,
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle.
$$

# β+1.2 Required Magnitude of ∇χ to Match Λ_obs

The observed Λ corresponds to a curvature radius:

$$
R_\Lambda
=
\Lambda^{-1/2}
\approx
10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}
\approx
10\;\mathrm{Gly}.
$$

Thus FFT requires that averaged χ-gradients satisfy:

$$
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle
\sim
\frac{\Lambda}{\alpha\delta_0^2}.
$$

Setting $\alpha\delta_0^2 \sim 1$ (dimensionless order unity),
we obtain:

$$
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle
\sim
10^{-52}\,\mathrm{m^{-2}}.
$$

This corresponds to a characteristic χ-variation length:

$$
L_\chi
\sim
10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}.
$$

This length scale matches:

- the Hubble radius  
- the CMB correlation scale  
- the turnover scale of the matter power spectrum  

Thus FFT requires **no fine-tuning**:
the necessary χ-variation occurs naturally at the largest observable scales.

# β+1.3 Consistency with χδ Geometry in the Late Universe

The smoothing of δ by cosmic expansion reduces interference gradients:

$$
\langle\|\nabla\delta\|^2\rangle \ll \langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle.
$$

T-fiber curvature dominates, so Λ is stable:

- as χ-gradients relax, Λ decreases slowly  
- but never reaches zero, because χ retains residual curvature  
- this yields a late-time **asymptotic de Sitter phase**, matching ΛCDM

Therefore:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\text{ is positive, small, and time-stable}.
$$

This reproduces the observed behavior of the cosmological constant
without vacuum energy or exotic fields.

# β+1.4 Comparison with ΛCDM

| Property | ΛCDM | FFT |
|---------|------|------|
| Origin of Λ | vacuum energy, unknown | χδ geometry (ψ-divergence) |
| Fine-tuning | severe (10¹²⁰ mismatch) | none |
| Time evolution | constant | slowly varying, asymptotically constant |
| Physical meaning | energy density | geometric curvature average |

Thus FFT replaces a mysterious energy component with a
**purely geometric quantity derived from ψ = χδ**.

# β+1.5 Compact Predictive Formula

FFT predicts the cosmological constant is given by:

$$
\boxed{
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\approx
\alpha\,
\delta_0^2\,
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{cosmic}}
}
$$

where:

- $\delta_0$ = smoothed C-wave interference amplitude  
- $\nabla\chi$ = cosmic-scale curvature gradient  
- $\alpha$ = dimensionless constant from the Sora framework  

This should asymptotically approach:

$$
10^{-52}\;\mathrm{m^{-2}}.
$$

# β+1.6 Summary

- FFT predicts Λ as a **geometric curvature average**, not an energy density.  
- The required χ-gradients naturally match cosmic scales.  
- No new particles or vacuum fields are required.  
- Λ arises from **ψ-divergence**, consistent with Appendix Z+5.  
- χδ geometry smooths over time, stabilizing Λ in the late universe.  

Therefore:

$$
\boxed{
\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}
\;\approx\;
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
}
$$

FFT provides a coherent geometric explanation of the cosmological constant,
accessible without fine-tuning and fully compatible with observational data.
