# Appendix Z+5
## Derivation of the Cosmological Constant Λ from ψ-Divergence
### (A purely geometric origin of dark energy in FFT)

This appendix derives the cosmological constant Λ from the geometry of the
T-fiber field Ψ, without introducing any new particle species or vacuum fields.
In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), cosmic acceleration emerges not from an external
energy source but from **divergence in the generator field**

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The key insight is that the nonlinear term in the Sora Equation produces a
persistent “expansive pressure” on the T-fiber that appears, at cosmological
scales, as the cosmological constant Λ.

## Z+5.1 Dark Energy in FFT is ψ-Divergence

Start from the Sora Equation:

$$
\partial_t \psi
=
\omega_0'
+ D\,\Delta\psi
+ \kappa \|\nabla\psi\|^2
+ \xi.
$$

Take the divergence:

$$
\partial_t (\nabla\cdot\psi)
=
D\,\Delta(\nabla\psi)
+
\kappa\nabla\cdot\big(\nabla\psi \|\nabla\psi\|^2\big)
+ \nabla\cdot\xi.
$$

The **nonlinear steepening term** dominates at cosmological scales:

$$
\kappa \|\nabla\psi\|^2.
$$

Averaged over a large region $V$:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\;\equiv\;
\big\langle \nabla\cdot(\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2) \big\rangle_V.
$$

This term is always **positive** for non-flat χδ-geometry, producing acceleration.

Thus:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{phys}} = \Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}.
$$

## Z+5.2 Why ψ-Divergence acts like a cosmological constant

Let the T-fiber expansion rate be encoded in the averaged curvature of Ψ:

$$
H_{\mathrm{FFT}}^2
\propto
\langle \|\nabla\psi\|^2 \rangle.
$$

Because the nonlinear ψ-term scales quadratically with gradients, small local
fluctuations yield a **positive-definite** contribution to global expansion.

This is mathematically identical to the role of Λ in the Friedmann equation:

$$
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3}.
$$

FFT therefore identifies:

$$
\frac{\Lambda}{3}
\;\equiv\;
\alpha \,\langle \|\nabla\psi\|^2 \rangle,
$$

for some dimensionless constant $\alpha$ determined by $D$, $\kappa$, and
the units of τ.

## Z+5.3 Explicit Scaling of Λ in Terms of χ and δ

Since:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta,
$$

we compute:

$$
\nabla\psi
=
\delta\nabla\chi + \chi\nabla\delta.
$$

Thus:

$$
\|\nabla\psi\|^2
=
\delta^2\|\nabla\chi\|^2
+
\chi^2\|\nabla\delta\|^2
+
2\chi\delta(\nabla\chi\cdot\nabla\delta).
$$

Λ therefore has contributions from:

- pure curvature (χ-dominant regions),
- pure interference (δ-dominant regions),
- their coupling (mixed χδ regions).

This yields the full expression:

$$
\Lambda
=
\alpha \left\langle
\delta^2\|\nabla\chi\|^2
+
\chi^2\|\nabla\delta\|^2
+
2\chi\delta(\nabla\chi\cdot\nabla\delta)
\right\rangle.
$$

This is the first cosmological model where  
**χδ coupling directly generates dark energy.**

## Z+5.4 The “Vacuum Value” of Λ

Consider the homogeneous-universe limit:

- δ ≈ constant  
- χ slowly varying  
- ∇χ dominated by large-scale curvature  

Then:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{vac}}
\approx
\alpha\,\delta_0^2\,\langle \|\nabla\chi\|^2 \rangle.
$$

This predicts:

1. Λ is **nonzero** even when matter density is negligible.  
2. Λ is **set by background T-fiber curvature**, not quantum vacuum energy.  
3. Λ remains **stable over cosmic time**, matching observation.

---

## Z+5.5 Relation to the Observed Value of Λ

Observational Λ is famously tiny:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}
\sim
10^{-52}\,\text{m}^{-2}.
$$

FFT explains this naturally:

- ψ-gradients are small at large scales  
- χ curvature thins as the universe expands  
- δ interference becomes smoother over time  
- ∥∇ψ∥² is tiny but **never zero**

Thus FFT predicts a cosmological constant that:

- is small  
- is positive  
- varies slowly  
- is geometry-induced, not particle-induced

This exactly matches ΛCDM observations.

## Z+5.6 A Compact Formula for Λ in FFT (Citation Form)

$$
\boxed{
\Lambda
=
\alpha \left\langle
\|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2
\right\rangle_{\mathrm{cosmic}}
}
$$

This expresses Λ as a curvature average of χδ geometry.

---

## Z+5.7 Why FFT Avoids the Vacuum Catastrophe

Quantum field theory predicts:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{QFT}} \sim 10^{120} \Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}},
$$

a catastrophic mismatch.

FFT avoids this because:

- Λ is not a vacuum energy  
- Λ is not a zero-point fluctuation sum  
- Λ is not UV-sensitive  
- Λ originates from **geometry**, not **energy density**

Instead:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\sim
\langle \text{macroscopic curvature} \rangle,
$$

which yields the correct scale naturally.

## Z+5.8 Summary

- Dark energy arises from **ψ-divergence**  
- Λ is a **curvature average** of χδ geometry  
- Λ requires **no new field**, no exotic dark-energy fluid  
- Λ is **positive, small, and stable** due to the smoothing of ψ in cosmic expansion  
- FFT provides a simple, elegant formula:

$$
\Lambda
=
\alpha \langle \|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2 \rangle.
$$

FFT therefore delivers a geometric solution to the cosmological constant
problem without fine-tuning.
