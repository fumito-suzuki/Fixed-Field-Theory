# Appendix Z+12  
## Physical Observables of the C-wave in FFT  
### (What Is Observable, and What Is Only Generated)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), physical reality is structured into three distinct
ontological layers:

- **T-wave (χ)** — causal field / matter itself  
- **C-wave (δ)** — interference field / information  
- **ψ** — generated phenomenon (appearance, geometry)

This appendix clarifies **what can be physically observed from the C-wave**,  
and how this differs from:

- T-wave observables (matter-level properties), and  
- ψ (which is *not* observed directly but *generated*).

---

## Z+12.1 Ontological Separation of the Three Layers

FFT strictly distinguishes:

### 1. T-wave (matter layer)

- causal substrate of reality  
- atoms, molecules, solids, fluids  
- biological receptors (retina, cochlea, skin, etc.)  
- mechanical vibration (sound)  
- thermal motion  

T-wave **exists independently of observation**.

---

### 2. C-wave (information layer)

- electromagnetic waves (light, IR, radio, X-ray, …)  
- directional and refractive  
- capable of interference and superposition  
- **does not carry χ (curvature)**  
- cannot become an *event* without a T-wave receptor  

C-wave is **pure information**, not substance.

---

### 3. ψ (generated phenomenon)

A crucial correction:

> **ψ is not a wave and not a field.  
> ψ is a generated phenomenon.**

ψ is defined as:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

ψ represents:

- visible surfaces  
- edges and contours  
- shading and shadow  
- apparent depth and occlusion  
- stable perceptual geometry  

ψ **does not propagate** and **cannot exist independently**.

ψ exists *only* when:

- C-wave interference (δ)  
- is received by T-wave matter (χ)

---

## Z+12.2 What Is a C-wave in Operational Terms?

In FFT, a **C-wave** is defined as:

> *An interference pattern that can become observable only when absorbed,
> scattered, or transduced by a T-wave receptor.*

Examples:

- photons hitting the retina  
- radio waves received by an antenna  
- infrared detected by a sensor  
- X-rays recorded on a detector  

Without a receptor:

- C-wave exists as interference  
- but **no observation occurs**  
- no ψ is generated  

This removes any need for a conscious observer.

---

## Z+12.3 Physically Observable Quantities of the C-wave

Only the following quantities of the C-wave are physically observable.

---

### (1) Intensity (Amplitude Squared)

$$
I(x,y,t) = |C(x,y,t)|^2.
$$

Observed as:

- brightness  
- radiation flux  
- signal strength  

All detectors measure **intensity**, never C itself.

---

### (2) Frequency / Spectrum

$$
\omega_C, \quad S(\omega_C) = |\hat{C}(\omega_C)|^2.
$$

Observed as:

- color  
- spectral lines  
- carrier frequency  

Spectrometers measure **frequency structure**, not χ.

---

### (3) Spatial Gradients and Curvature

$$
\nabla C, \quad \Delta C.
$$

These encode:

- edges and contours  
- interference fringes  
- focusing and defocusing  

Biological vision and image processing both compute ∇C-like quantities.

---

### (4) Relative Phase (Only via Interference)

$$
\phi_{12}
=
\arg\!\left(C_1^* C_2\right).
$$

Phase is never observed directly.

Only **interference outcomes** are observable.

---

## Z+12.4 What Is *Not* Observable from the C-wave

FFT explicitly excludes the following as direct observables:

- χ (causal curvature)  
- ψ itself  
- Z-depth  
- τ (phase-time)  

These are **inferred or generated**, not observed.

---

## Z+12.5 Contrast: T-wave Observables

T-wave observables include:

- mass and inertia  
- mechanical motion  
- sound (pressure waves in matter)  
- temperature  
- chemical interaction (smell, binding)

These do not require C-waves.

Matter exists and evolves in the dark.

---

## Z+12.6 ψ as a Generated Phenomenon (Not an Observable)

ψ is **never directly observed**.

What is experienced as:

- “shape”  
- “surface”  
- “depth”  

is the **phenomenal geometry** generated when C-wave information interacts with
T-wave matter.

Thus:

> **We do not observe ψ.  
> We experience the world *as ψ*.**

This resolves the apparent ambiguity between perception and measurement.

---

## Z+12.7 Experimental Correspondence

FFT observables map cleanly onto experiments:

| FFT Quantity | Physical Measurement |
|-------------|----------------------|
| $|C|^2$ | CCD, CMOS, PMT |
| spectrum | spectrometers |
| ∇C, ΔC | edge detection, interferometry |
| phase difference | holography, VLBI |

No experiment directly measures χ or ψ.

---

## Z+12.8 Summary

In FFT:

- **T-wave (χ)** = matter and causal history  
- **C-wave (δ)** = information and interference  
- **ψ** = generated phenomenon (appearance)

The **only physically observable quantities** of the C-wave are:

$$
\boxed{
\left\{
|C|^2,\;
\omega_C,\;
\nabla C,\;
\text{interference-derived phase}
\right\}
}
$$

ψ is not an observable entity but the **phenomenal geometry produced** when
information is received by matter.

This distinction is essential for avoiding category errors in quantum,
perceptual, and cosmological discussions within FFT.
