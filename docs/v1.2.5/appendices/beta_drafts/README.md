# Appendix β — Draft Extensions (Non-Canonical)

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x — Internal / Incubation Materials)*

## 1. Purpose and Status

Appendix β contains **non-canonical draft materials** for Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

These documents explore:

- provisional interpretations,
- candidate mathematical structures,
- speculative physical implications,
- and measurement-level hypotheses

that are **not adopted** into the official FFT v1.2.x framework.

Material in this group serves as an **incubation layer** for future development.

## 2. Relationship to the Canonical FFT Structure

The canonical FFT documentation consists of:

- the main paper (FFT v1.2.x),
- Appendix Z (formal theoretical extensions),
- Appendix A/B/C (interpretive and explanatory supplements).

**Appendix β is explicitly excluded** from this canonical structure.

Accordingly:

- Appendix β is **not referenced** from the main paper.
- Appendix β is **not listed** in `appendices/README.md`.
- Appendix β does **not define or modify** any official FFT axioms.

The presence of a draft in Appendix β **does not imply endorsement**.

## 3. Intended Use

Documents in Appendix β may:

- contain stronger or more speculative claims than Appendix Z,
- propose testable predictions ahead of formal derivation,
- temporarily violate strict minimality or rigor,
- overlap with open problems listed in Section 8 of the main text.

Each document is understood to be **subject to revision, promotion, or removal**.

Possible future outcomes include:

- promotion to Appendix Z,
- incorporation into the main paper (v1.3+),
- partial extraction into equations or tools,
- or complete archival.

## 4. Formatting Convention

Appendix β documents follow the **same structural template** as other appendices:

1. Purpose and Scope  
2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)  
3. Main Model or Argument  
4. Relation to χδ Geometry  
5. Implications (if any)  
6. Link to Open Problems  
7. Summary  

This uniformity is intentional and does **not** indicate equal status.

## 5. Reader Guidance

Readers should interpret Appendix β texts as:

> **working research notes written in appendix form**,  
> not as finalized components of Fixed-Field Theory.

No conclusions drawn solely from Appendix β should be attributed to FFT v1.2.x.

## 6. Summary

- Appendix β is a **draft-only, non-canonical layer**.
- It enables forward exploration without destabilizing the theory.
- Its contents may evolve, migrate, or disappear in future versions.

This separation preserves the internal coherence of FFT  
while allowing controlled theoretical growth.
