# Appendix Z+8  
## The Three-Layer Wave–Geometry Structure of FFT  
### (T-wave, C-wave, and ψ as Distinct Physical Entities)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), physical reality arises from the interaction
between two fundamentally different wave-like fields and one geometrical field:

1. **T-wave** — the continuous causal field (matter)  
2. **C-wave** — the interference field (information / light)  
3. **ψ** — the generated geometry (visible shape), produced by χδ  

These three layers form the minimal structure required to generate perception,
mass, and spacetime-like behavior.

This appendix formalizes their definitions and clarifies their distinct roles.

## Z+8.1 T-wave: The Continuous Causal Field (Matter)

**Definition.**  
The T-wave is the continuous, persistent causal thread along the Z-axis,
representing the **stacked time-density** of matter.

Properties:

- continuous (non-discrete)  
- non-directional  
- not refracted  
- acts as a **receptor for C-wave**  
- determines the solidity and inertia of objects  
- corresponds to χ, the causal curvature

Mathematically:

\[
\text{T-wave} \sim \chi(x,y,z)
\]

It is better interpreted as **matter itself**, not as a propagating wave.

## Z+8.2 C-wave: The Interference Field (Information)

**Definition.**  
The C-wave is the field of directional interference patterns, including:

- visible light  
- infrared  
- radio waves  
- electromagnetic interference  
- weak conceptual interference (“conceptual wave”)

Its essential property:

> **C-wave does not create matter—it creates “appearance.”**  
> It reshapes ψ only where it contacts the T-wave receptor.

Characteristics:

- directional / refracted / absorbed  
- frequency-dependent propagation  
- responsible for color, brightness, reflection, shadow  
- corresponds to δ, the interference density

Mathematically:

\[
\text{C-wave} \sim \delta(x,y,t)
\]

Thus, C-wave is **information**, not substance.

## Z+8.3 ψ: Generated Geometry (Not a Wave)

A crucial refinement:

> **ψ is not a wave.  
It is the geometry produced by the interaction χδ.**

ψ is defined by:

\[
\psi = \chi\,\delta.
\]

This means:

- χ (T-wave) provides causal mass  
- δ (C-wave) provides pattern  
- ψ is the *shape* resulting from their intersection

ψ gives:

- object boundaries  
- surface textures  
- shadow geometry  
- mass-density gradients  
- perceptual stability

It is a **generated field**, not a propagating one.

Thus, ψ should be understood as:

> **the visible form of reality.**

## Z+8.4 Relationship Between the Layers

The three layers interact as follows:

### 1. T-wave (χ)  
provides the **substrate**.

### 2. C-wave (δ)  
provides **directional modulation**.

### 3. ψ = χδ  
produces **observable reality**.

Symbolically:

\[
\text{matter (χ)} + \text{information (δ)} \rightarrow \text{shape (ψ)}.
\]

This hierarchy produces:

- light reflection = C interacting with the surface χ  
- shadows = ψ formed under absence of δ  
- mass perception = ∇ψ  
- optical illusions = δ misalignment  
- decoherence = Z-axis misalignment causing ψ instability  

The entire observable universe emerges from this **tri-layer structure**.

## Z+8.5 Why ψ Is Not a Third Wave

Calling ψ a wave would create several conceptual errors:

1. It does not propagate.  
2. It does not have a well-defined frequency.  
3. It is a *result*, not a field with its own independent dynamics.  
4. The Sora equation governing ψ is a *geometry-evolution equation*, not a wave equation.

Proper interpretation:

\[
\psi = \text{“geometry of interference”}
\]

not a wave.

This correction brings FFT into perfect internal consistency.

## Z+8.6 Physical Interpretation Summary

| Entity | Nature | Physical Meaning | Mathematical Symbol |
|--------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **T-wave** | continuous, causal | matter, solidity | χ |
| **C-wave** | directional, refractive | information, perception | δ |
| **ψ** | generated geometry | visible form, surface shape | χδ |

This structure is the backbone of FFT and clarifies:

- why light reveals objects  
- why matter does not shine without C-wave  
- why perception is 2.5D  
- why quantum collapse relates to ψ stability  
- why decoherence is ΔZ divergence  
- why neutrinos behave like “ghost waves” (Z+19)

## Z+8.7 Consequences for Later Appendices

The tri-layer distinction directly reinforces:

- Z+13（テレポート＝Z-index 切替）  
- Z+17（Heisenberg＝ΔZ 投影）  
- Z+19（ニュートリノ＝低干渉C-wave）  
- Z+37B（球面宇宙＝ψ 投影）  

ψ の再定義は、むしろ FFT 全体の整合性を最大化する。

## Z+8.8 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{T-wave = matter (curvature)} \\
\textbf{C-wave = information (interference)} \\
\textbf{ψ = geometry (observable shape)}
}
\]

FFT’s three-layer model is therefore:

- physically coherent  
- mathematically minimal  
- intuitively visual  
- and compatible with all later phenomena in the theory.
