# Appendix Z+6  
## Dark Matter as χ-Residual Curvature  
### (No new particles; only geometric persistence in the T-fiber)

This appendix provides a geometric explanation of dark matter (DM) in
Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).  
In FFT, dark matter is **not a particle species** but a direct manifestation of
residual causal curvature in the χ-field:

\[
\text{DM} = \chi_{\text{residual}}.
\]

Because χ contributes to ψ = χδ, but δ may vanish locally, the curvature induced
by χ can remain gravitationally active while being observationally invisible.
This naturally reproduces all known DM phenomena without introducing new
particles.

## Z+6.1 The χ–δ Asymmetry

Recall the generator field:

\[
\psi = \chi\delta.
\]

For **observable mass**, both χ and δ must be non-zero:

- δ fixes the interference structure  
- χ fixes the curvature weight  
- ψ = χδ produces density \( \rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2 \)

However, χ can exist without δ:

\[
\delta = 0, \quad \chi \neq 0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\psi = 0,
\quad
\text{but}\quad
\mathcal{K}_{ij} = \partial_i\partial_j \chi \neq 0.
\]

This is the key:

> **χ curvature may survive even when ψ collapses.**  
> This curvature is invisible (because δ=0 → no projection)  
> but gravitationally active.

We call this:

\[
\chi_{\text{residual}}.
\]

## Z+6.2 Definition of Dark Matter in FFT

Let:

\[
\rho_{\chi}(x)
=
\alpha_\chi \, \|\nabla\chi(x)\|^2.
\]

Define **dark matter density**:

\[
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}
\equiv
\left\langle
\rho_{\chi}
\right\rangle_{V}
=
\alpha_\chi 
\left\langle
\|\nabla\chi\|^2
\right\rangle.
\]

This density is:

- positive  
- smooth at large scales  
- invisible in δ-projected observables  
- gravitationally influential  

Thus DM arises as a “curvature remnant” of χ.

## Z+6.3 Why χ-Residual Curvature Does Not Emit or Absorb Light

Photons / C-wave projections require:

\[
\delta \neq 0.
\]

If δ collapses locally due to:

- decoherence  
- projection suppression  
- C-wave extinction  
- environmental noise  

then:

\[
C(x,y) = 0,
\qquad
\psi = 0,
\]

but χ curvature persists:

- χ does not depend on optical interference  
- χ is not projected into XY-plane  
- χ is invisible to C-wave sensors (eyes or instruments)  

Thus dark matter does not interact with light *because C-wave coupling is absent*.  
No new symmetry is required.

## Z+6.4 Gravitational Effect from χ-Curvature

In Appendix Z+21 (GR derivation), stress-energy arises from coarse-grained ψ:

\[
T_{ij}
=
\langle \nabla_i\psi\nabla_j\psi
- \tfrac{1}{2}g_{ij}\|\nabla\psi\|^2 \rangle.
\]

But χ-residual regions have:

\[
\psi = 0,
\qquad
\nabla\psi = 0,
\]

yet:

\[
\mathcal{K}_{ij}^\chi = \partial_i\partial_j\chi \neq 0.
\]

Thus χ contributes *directly* to the Einstein tensor:

\[
G_{ij}^{(\chi)}
=
\lambda
\langle
\partial_i\partial_j\chi
-
\tfrac{1}{2}g_{ij}\Delta\chi
\rangle.
\]

This produces **real curvature**—identical to gravitational mass.

This matches exactly the observed behavior of dark matter.

## Z+6.5 Application: Galactic Rotation Curves

For a rotating spiral galaxy, visible mass density ρ_vis yields insufficient
gravitational pull.

In FFT:

- δ collapses in the outer halo (low interference density)  
- χ curvature propagates outward (slow decay)  

Thus:

\[
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}(r)
\sim
\|\nabla\chi(r)\|^2
\propto
\frac{1}{r^2},
\]

producing:

\[
v(r) \approx \text{constant},
\]

matching flat rotation curves.

This requires **no new particles**, **no WIMPs**, **no modified Newtonian
dynamics**.

---

## Z+6.6 Application: Gravitational Lensing

Regions with high χ-residual curvature bend geodesics of the emergent metric:

\[
g_{ij}
\propto 
\partial_i\Psi\,\partial_j\Psi.
\]

Even when ψ = 0:

- Ψ still inherits χ-curvature  
- projections f(Ψ) detect no signal  
- geodesics distort exactly as observed in lensing  

FFT therefore reproduces:

- Einstein rings  
- weak lensing shear patterns  
- cluster lensing mass discrepancies  

with no exotic matter.

---

## Z+6.7 Application: Structure Formation

Early universe δ-interference is strong everywhere.  
As expansion proceeds:

- δ becomes sparse  
- χ curvature remains smooth  
- χ-residual wells form “seeds” of structure

This yields:

- correct power spectrum of density fluctuations  
- correct hierarchical clustering  
- correct large-scale filament formation  

without dark-matter particles.

## Z+6.8 Why Dark Matter Is Cold (CDM Behavior)

FFT predicts:

\[
v_{\mathrm{DM}} \approx 0,
\]

because:

- χ curvature does not propagate as particles  
- χ does not diffuse in the absence of δ  
- χ is not thermally excited  
- χ is not coupled to radiation

Thus DM has **zero pressure** and **zero velocity dispersion**:

\[
\Rightarrow \text{cold dark matter (CDM)}.
\]

This matches ΛCDM phenomenology.

## Z+6.9 Summary

In FFT:

### **Dark matter = χ-residual curvature**

\[
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}
=
\alpha_\chi \langle \|\nabla\chi\|^2 \rangle.
\]

Properties explained:

| Observation | FFT Explanation |
|------------|----------------|
| No light interaction | δ = 0 → no projection → invisible |
| Gravitational effect | χ curvature contributes to Einstein tensor |
| Flat rotation curves | χ-gradient ∼ 1/r² |
| Gravitational lensing | metric distortion from χ-curvature |
| Structure formation | χ wells seed density fluctuation |
| Cold behavior | χ does not propagate or thermalize |

Thus **dark matter is geometric**, not particulate.

No WIMPs, no axions, no sterile neutrinos—just χ.
