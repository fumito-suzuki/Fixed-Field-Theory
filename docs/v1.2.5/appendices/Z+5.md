# Appendix Z+5 — Derivation of the Cosmological Constant Λ from ψ-Divergence

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix derives the cosmological constant Λ from the geometry of the
generator field ψ within Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), without introducing new
particle species or vacuum energy fields.

It demonstrates that cosmic acceleration arises as a geometric consequence of
ψ-divergence driven by χδ coupling and the nonlinear structure of the Sora
Equation.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, the generator field is defined by

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The evolution of ψ is governed by the Sora Equation, whose nonlinear terms encode
the geometric response of the T-fiber to curvature and interference.

At cosmological scales, ψ-gradients act as a persistent expansive influence on
the underlying geometry.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 ψ-Divergence from the Sora Equation

The Sora Equation for ψ is

$$
\partial_t \psi =
\omega_0' +
D\,\Delta\psi +
\kappa \|\nabla\psi\|^2 +
\xi.
$$

Taking the divergence yields

$$
\partial_t (\nabla\cdot\psi) =
D\,\Delta(\nabla\psi) +
\kappa\nabla\cdot\!\left(\nabla\psi \|\nabla\psi\|^2\right) +
\nabla\cdot\xi.
$$

At cosmological scales, the nonlinear steepening term dominates.

### 3.2 Definition of Λ in FFT

Define the FFT cosmological constant as the volume-averaged ψ-divergence:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\equiv
\left\langle
\nabla\cdot\!\left(\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2\right)
\right\rangle_V.
$$

For non-flat χδ geometry, this quantity is positive-definite and produces
accelerated expansion.

The physical cosmological constant is therefore identified as

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{phys}} = \Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}.
$$

### 3.3 Relation to Expansion Rate

Let the effective T-fiber expansion rate satisfy

$$
H_{\mathrm{FFT}}^2
\propto
\left\langle \|\nabla\psi\|^2 \right\rangle.
$$

This matches the role of Λ in the Friedmann equation

$$
H^2 =
\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho +
\frac{\Lambda}{3}.
$$

Accordingly,

$$
\frac{\Lambda}{3} =
\alpha
\left\langle \|\nabla\psi\|^2 \right\rangle,
$$

where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant determined by χδ scaling and τ-units.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Since

$$
\psi = \chi\delta,
$$

its gradient satisfies

$$
\nabla\psi =
\delta\nabla\chi +
\chi\nabla\delta.
$$

Thus,

$$
\|\nabla\psi\|^2 =
\delta^2\|\nabla\chi\|^2 +
\chi^2\|\nabla\delta\|^2 +
2\chi\delta(\nabla\chi\cdot\nabla\delta).
$$

The cosmological constant therefore receives contributions from pure curvature,
pure interference, and mixed χδ regions.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

- Section 6: Λ emerges from ψ-curvature rather than vacuum energy.
- Section 4: large-scale ψ-smoothing explains cosmic acceleration.
- Section 7: stability of χδ geometry ensures Λ remains slowly varying.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- the geometric origin of dark energy,
- stability of Λ under cosmic expansion,
- avoidance of the vacuum energy catastrophe.

## 7. Summary

The cosmological constant in FFT is given by the compact expression

$$
\boxed{
\Lambda =
\alpha
\left\langle
\|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2
\right\rangle_{\mathrm{cosmic}}
}
$$

Dark energy is thus a purely geometric effect arising from ψ-divergence, requiring
no fine-tuning and no additional fields.
