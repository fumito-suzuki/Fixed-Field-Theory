# Appendix Z+13 — Quantum Teleportation as Arrival-Time Reassignment  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix supports Section 5 (quantum phenomena) and the observation logic
used across Sections 3–7 by formalizing the FFT interpretation of quantum
teleportation.

It addresses the following goals:

- clarify why teleportation is not state transfer in FFT,
- derive teleportation as an arrival-time reassignment on C-wave reception,
- connect χ, δ, ψ, and τ to “where an event appears,”
- align teleportation with collapse and decoherence as τ-order instability.

This appendix does not add new dynamics.
It fixes interpretation under the χδ–ψ observational hierarchy.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT is founded on the χδ principle (Appendix Z+0):

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Here:

- χ is the causal-curvature weight carried by the T-wave (receptor layer),
- δ is the interference information carried by the C-wave (information layer),
- ψ is the generated phenomenon that appears only at reception.

The main text repeatedly emphasizes that ψ is not a physical wave.
Teleportation is treated accordingly as a change in ψ-generation conditions,
not as transport of a substance.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Setup

Consider two spatially separated T-wave receptors, labeled B and C.
A single C-wave information pattern is prepared such that it can reach either
receptor.

Define:

- receptor weights $\chi_B$ and $\chi_C$,
- arriving interference pattern $\delta_{\mathrm{arrive}}$,
- arrival phase-times $\tau_B$ and $\tau_C$.

An observation event occurs only at reception:

$$
\psi_B = \chi_B\,\delta_{\mathrm{arrive}},
\qquad
\psi_C = \chi_C\,\delta_{\mathrm{arrive}}.
$$

### 3.2 Key Equations

The core statement of this appendix is:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Quantum teleportation in FFT} =
\text{reassignment of the C-wave arrival time } \tau
\text{ at a different T-wave receptor.}
}
$$

Event selection is determined by the ordering of arrival times:

$$
\tau_B < \tau_C
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\tau_C < \tau_B.
$$

The first-arrival receptor generates ψ first:

$$
\tau_B < \tau_C
\ \Longrightarrow\
\psi_{\mathrm{first}} = \psi_B,
\qquad
\tau_C < \tau_B
\ \Longrightarrow\
\psi_{\mathrm{first}} = \psi_C.
$$

### 3.3 Result

Teleportation is the change of which receptor satisfies first-arrival under the
same C-wave information structure:

- the C-wave pattern is not transferred from B to C,
- no object propagates between receptors as ψ,
- the generated phenomenon appears where arrival-time ordering selects.

A minimal everyday analogy is “one utterance, two listeners”:

- the content is identical,
- the only difference is arrival time,
- no transmission occurs from the earlier listener to the later one.

Teleportation is the same structure, formalized as τ-order switching.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

This interpretation follows directly from χδ coupling:

- δ carries interference information but is not observed alone,
- χ supplies receptor curvature weight,
- ψ is generated only at contact.

Thus, changing the ordering of $\tau_B$ and $\tau_C$ changes only the location
and time where $\chi\delta$ is instantiated as an event.

No additional ontology is introduced.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines the reading of quantum sections as follows:

- Section 3 (irreversibility): “event fixation” is ψ-generation on a receptor,
  not propagation of ψ.
- Section 5 (entanglement/teleportation): entanglement corresponds to a single
  C-wave structure available to multiple receptors prior to ψ-generation.
- Section 7 (consciousness/selection): selection acts on χ-side conditions and
  τ-order stability, not on ψ as a transported entity.

Misreading teleportation as state transfer would reintroduce category confusion
between δ, χ, and ψ.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.3** — observation logic in distributed receptor systems (arrival-time geometry),
- **8.5** — τ stability under perturbations (ordering robustness),
- **8.9** — formal definition of τ as operational delay in projection geometry,
- **8.10** — χ-selection conditions under competing τ-orderings.

## 7. Summary

Teleportation in FFT is not transmission.

$$
\boxed{
\text{Teleportation} =
\text{arrival-time reassignment of the same C-wave information at a different receptor.}
}
$$

- C-wave (δ) is information and is not observed alone,
- T-wave (χ) is the receptor curvature weight,
- ψ is the generated phenomenon $\psi=\chi\delta$ at reception,
- the “teleported event” is the reassignment of where first-arrival generates ψ.
