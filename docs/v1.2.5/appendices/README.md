# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

> **Note on Perspective**  
> Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) does not contradict existing physical theories.  
> Quantum theory observes the microscopic world through a narrow field of view,  
> while cosmology observes the macroscopic world through a similarly constrained lens.  
> FFT adopts a **wider field of view**, within which both limits are naturally recovered.  
> As this field of view is narrowed, FFT converges smoothly with established theories.

This directory contains all supplementary materials for the FFT v1.2.x series.  
The appendices provide mathematical proofs, projection operators, χδ geometry,
τ-time analysis, perceptual models, cosmological extensions, and experimental
considerations that support the main manuscript.

This README explains **how to navigate the Appendix set** and  
**how each appendix relates to Sections 1–7 of FFT v1.2.5.1**.

# 1. Purpose of the Appendices

The main manuscript introduces:

- χδ geometry（χ = causal depth, δ = interference density）  
- ψ = χδ（appearance field; not a physical wave）  
- T-fiber / T-wave（physical structure）  
- C-wave（XτZ / YτZ projection）  
- τ（phase-time）  
- FFT-1 / FFT-2 / FFT-3（field, information, projection dynamics）  
- Sora Equation（ψ dynamics on the C-wave）  
- G-operator（Z-extension → χ-band reconstruction）  
- consciousness as the selection of χ  

Many of these require **extended derivations** or **geometric formalization**,  
which are provided in the appendices.

Appendices serve as:

- mathematical proofs  
- operator-level definitions（f-projection, G-extension）  
- perceptual / optical geometry  
- χδ-oscillation and ψ-dynamics  
- cosmological curvature models  
- experimental proposals  
- cross-scale curvature interpretation  

They are **mandatory companions** to the main theory.

### Design Principle: Absence of N and J

- FFT does not introduce **N** (particle number) or **J** (flux / current)
  as fundamental quantities.
- Multiplicity (**N**) and flux (**J**) are **derived geometric consequences**
  of χδ interaction, not independent degrees of freedom.
- Introducing N or J as primitive terms would reintroduce
  particle-number conservation and current-conservation assumptions,
  which FFT explicitly avoids.
- Therefore, **FFT-1 is closed by construction**, not by completion or
  enumeration of interaction terms.

# 2. How to Use the Appendices

You may navigate the appendices in two ways:

## A. Section-driven reading  
Use the **Section–Appendix Map** (below) to open the appendix that supports the
specific section you are reading in the main text.

## B. Domain-driven reading  
Appendices naturally cluster into four conceptual domains.

# 6. Contribution Notes（更新ポリシー）

- Appendices must remain **self-contained** and consistent with FFT Sections 1–7.  
- Updating Sections 1–7 requires updating this README.  
- Notation must follow FFT conventions：χ, δ, ψ, τ, C-wave, T-fiber.  
- ψ is **not a wave**, but an *appearance field*.  
- Probability is **not postulated**; it emerges from projection geometry (Z+23).  
- G-operator returns both **Z-extension and χ-band reconstruction**.  
- New appendices must be added to both the **Domain Map** and the  
  **Open Problem Map**.
