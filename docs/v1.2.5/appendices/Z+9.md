# Appendix Z+9 — Phase-Time τ and the Emergence of Apparent 3D Space

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix formalizes the concept of **phase-time τ** in Fixed-Field Theory
(FFT) and explains how apparent three-dimensional space emerges from a
fundamentally lower-dimensional structure.

Its purpose is to clarify:

- why time is not fundamental in FFT,
- how τ arises from stable interference,
- how depth is encoded as past-lag (ΔZ),
- how apparent 3D space is reconstructed from τ-shifted projections.

This appendix provides a minimal geometric account required for interpreting
Sections 3 and 4 of the main text.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, the T-fiber field is fundamentally timeless.
No external or absolute time parameter is assumed.

When interference patterns δ become locally stable, a repeating phase structure
emerges. This structure defines **phase-time**:

$$
\tau = \text{phase-time}.
$$

The rate of τ corresponds to the atomic reference frequency:

$$
\omega_0' = \frac{d\tau}{dt}.
$$

Phase-time τ constitutes the minimal causal structure required for observation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Depth as Past-Lag (ΔZ)

The Z-axis in FFT is not a spatial direction.
It records accumulated causal history of the T-fiber.

Define depth as:

$$
\Delta Z = \text{lag in }\tau\text{-phase}.
$$

C-wave projections carry different τ-values depending on their propagation
history. Perceived depth arises from these τ-lags.

Thus:

$$
\text{depth} = \Delta Z.
$$

No independent third spatial dimension is required.
Depth is a temporal offset encoded in phase structure.

### 3.2 Reconstruction of Apparent 3D Space

Observation receives two τ-shifted projections:

1. XZ-plane projection,
2. YZ-plane projection.

The perceptual system aligns τ-phase across rays and reconstructs position as:

$$
\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{perceived}} = (X, Y, \Delta Z).
$$

This procedure produces the appearance of three-dimensional space, even though
the underlying structure consists only of:

- XY-plane interference,
- Z-axis accumulation,
- τ-phase stability.

Therefore:

$$
\text{3D space is a reconstructed percept, not an ontological structure}.
$$

### 3.3 Occlusion and the Visibility of Surfaces

Along each visual ray, the C-wave selects the nearest τ-stable surface,
corresponding to the smallest ΔZ.

All deeper layers possess larger τ-lag and fail phase alignment, collapsing into
a τ-deficit region:

$$
\text{shadow} = \tau\text{-deficit region}.
$$

This accounts for:

- occlusion,
- visibility of only front-facing surfaces,
- the fact that shadows represent τ-misalignment rather than absence of light.

### 3.4 Apparent Sphericity

For any extended region, ΔZ increases radially.
Under τ-based reconstruction, boundaries appear isotropic, producing the
perception of spherical form.

This is a perceptual consequence of τ-projection geometry, not a cosmological
statement.

A cosmic-scale analysis is treated separately in Appendix Z+37B.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Phase-time τ emerges only when χ and δ jointly produce stable ψ.

Depth reconstruction relies on:

- χ-history accumulation along Z,
- δ-mediated phase coherence,
- ψ-stability under projection.

Thus τ provides the bridge between causal structure and perceptual geometry.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies interpretations used in the main text:

- Section 3: irreversibility arises from ΔZ accumulation.
- Section 4: depth perception is τ-based reconstruction, not spatial sensing.
- Section 7: stable consciousness requires τ-coherent χ-selection.

Misinterpreting Z as a spatial axis breaks these interpretations.

## 6. Summary

Phase-time τ is defined as the coherence of T-fiber interference:

$$
\boxed{
\tau = \text{phase coherence of T-fiber interference}.
}
$$

Depth is encoded as past-lag:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Depth} = \Delta Z = \text{past-lag, not a spatial dimension}.
}
$$

Apparent three-dimensional space arises from reconstruction:

$$
\boxed{
\text{3D space} = \text{alignment of two }\tau\text{-shifted 2D projections}.
}
$$

This appendix provides the minimal FFT account of how a fundamentally 2.5D
structure produces the appearance of a coherent 3D world.
