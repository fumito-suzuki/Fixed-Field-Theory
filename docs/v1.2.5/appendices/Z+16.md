# Appendix Z+16 — Decoherence as Zχ-Divergence  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), decoherence is not a stochastic collapse,
nor an abstract loss of phase information.

It is a **geometric and deterministic process**:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\textbf{divergence of causal depth } Z_\chi.
}
$$

This appendix formalizes decoherence as the **spreading of χτ-accumulated
causal depth**, and strictly separates it from observational delay effects
$Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT distinguishes two fundamentally different notions of depth.

### Causal depth: $Z_\chi$

- defined on the **T-wave (χ)**,
- accumulates irreversible interaction history,
- exists independently of observation,
- determines coherence and entanglement.

Formally,

$$
Z_\chi
=
\int \omega_0' \, dt
+
\sum \Delta Z_\chi^{(\mathrm{interaction})}.
$$

### Observational depth: $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$

- appears only through **projection**,
- encodes arrival-time structure of C-waves,
- depends on geometry and propagation,
- cannot influence coherence itself.

Formally,

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \sim \tau_{\mathrm{arrival}}.
$$

Decoherence is governed exclusively by $Z_\chi$.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

Consider a system whose internal causal structure initially satisfies

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \approx 0.
$$

This corresponds to:

- well-defined χτ history,
- stable ψ-generation,
- quantum-coherent behavior.

Decoherence occurs when causal dispersion begins:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d}{dt}\,\Delta Z_\chi > 0.
}
$$

That is, **the causal depth of the system spreads over time**.

No reference to observers, measurement postulates, or probability is required.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Decoherence originates from unavoidable **χ-interactions** with the environment.

Examples include:

- collisions with surrounding matter,
- thermal vibrations,
- electromagnetic contact via receptors,
- mechanical or boundary coupling.

Each interaction contributes a χ-update:

$$
\chi \rightarrow \chi + \delta\chi,
\qquad
Z_\chi \rightarrow Z_\chi + \delta Z_\chi.
$$

Because environmental interactions are distributed and non-identical,
$Z_\chi$ necessarily spreads.

This spreading is **monotonic and irreversible**.

A crucial consequence of χδ geometry is that **C-waves alone do not cause
decoherence**.

C-waves:

- are interference patterns,
- do not carry χ,
- require T-wave contact to affect causal structure.

Thus:

- propagation without absorption  
  → no χ-update  
  → no decoherence.

Decoherence begins only when χ-interaction occurs.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

Measurement is not a special postulate; it is simply **strong environmental
χ-coupling**.

During measurement:

- many χ-channels interact simultaneously,
- δ-patterns collapse locally,
- ψ-generation becomes environment-dependent.

As a result,

$$
\Delta Z_\chi
\;\text{increases rapidly}.
$$

This rapid divergence destroys:

- phase coherence,
- entanglement,
- interference visibility.

What is traditionally called *wavefunction collapse* is therefore forced
$Z_\chi$-divergence.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix directly connects to:

- **Z+15 (Entanglement)**  
  Entanglement requires
  $$
  Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}.
  $$
  Decoherence breaks this condition:
  $$
  |Z_{\chi,A} - Z_{\chi,B}| > 0.
  $$

- **Z+13 (Teleportation)**  
  Teleportation operates on $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$.
  Decoherence destroys $Z_\chi$ alignment even when arrival-time information
  remains available.

- **Section 8**  
  Emergence of probability, the classical limit, and irreversibility.

## 7. Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence}
=
\textbf{irreversible divergence of } Z_\chi.
}
$$

- caused by environmental χ-interactions,
- independent of observers or consciousness,
- requires T-wave contact,
- destroys entanglement and interference,
- yields the classical limit.

FFT thus replaces probabilistic collapse with a **geometric inevitability**:
the spreading of causal depth in a connected universe.
