## Quantum Entanglement as χ-Depth Coherence  
### (C-wave Branching without ψ Generation)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum entanglement is **not** a nonlocal influence
and **not** a shared particle state.  
It is a preparatory geometric condition in which **multiple C-wave branches
remain coherent with respect to causal curvature χ**, while **no observable
phenomenon ψ has yet been generated**.

The core statement is:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum entanglement = coherent C-wave branching under a shared } Z_\chi
}
\]

No particle exists.  
No observation has occurred.  
Only **potential ψ-generation sites** are prepared.

## Z+15.1 Two Distinct Notions of “Z-depth” in FFT

To avoid ambiguity, FFT distinguishes two fundamentally different depths:

### (1) Causal depth: \( Z_\chi \)

- defined by χ and τ accumulation  
- encodes irreversible causal history  
- governs decoherence and collapse  
- **not directly observable**

### (2) Observational depth: \( Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \)

- arises from C-wave arrival delay  
- corresponds to 2.5D depth (XτZ / YτZ)  
- determines *when* ψ may be generated  
- **purely perceptual / observational**

This appendix concerns **\( Z_\chi \)** only.

## Z+15.2 What “Entangled” Means in FFT

Two systems A and B are entangled when:

- a single C-wave structure branches toward both systems, and  
- those branches remain coherent under the same χ-curvature background.

Formally:

\[
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B},
\qquad
\text{while }
\psi_A = \psi_B = 0.
\]

That is:

- no ψ has been generated,  
- no particle exists,  
- no observation has occurred.

Entanglement is therefore a **pre-observational condition**.

## Z+15.3 Entanglement Is Not Correlation of Particles

In FFT:

- particles are ψ-events,  
- ψ exists only when C-wave meets a T-wave receptor.

Since entangled systems satisfy:

\[
\psi = 0,
\]

there are **no particles to correlate**.

Thus:

> **Quantum entanglement is not particle correlation,  
> but coherence of unobserved C-wave branches.**

This directly explains why entanglement cannot be used for signaling.

## Z+15.4 Relation to Measurement: Loss of χ-Coherence

Measurement introduces environmental χ:

\[
\chi \rightarrow \chi + \delta\chi.
\]

Through Sora dynamics, this causes divergence in causal depth:

\[
Z_{\chi,A} \neq Z_{\chi,B}.
\]

Once χ-coherence is lost:

- C-wave branches no longer remain phase-aligned,  
- interference terms vanish,  
- entanglement is destroyed.

This process is **decoherence**, formalized in Appendix Z+16.

---

## Z+15.5 Why Entanglement Appears Nonlocal

Observers access only ψ-events on the XY-plane.

Because:

- entanglement occurs before ψ generation, and  
- ψ generation may occur at spatially separated locations,

the sequence:

1. ψ appears at A  
2. ψ appears at B  

is mistakenly interpreted as “instantaneous influence.”

In FFT, this is simply:

> **two independent ψ generations from the same prior C-wave structure.**

No information travels between A and B.

---

## Z+15.6 Relation to Teleportation (Z+13)

- **Entanglement (Z+15)**  
  → C-wave branching with χ-coherence, ψ = 0  

- **Teleportation (Z+13)**  
  → reassignment of which branch generates ψ first  
  → determined by arrival-time ordering \( Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \)

Thus:

- entanglement prepares possibilities,  
- teleportation selects the ψ-generation site,  
- collapse finalizes history in \( Z_\chi \).

---

## Z+15.7 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum entanglement = coherent C-wave branching under shared } Z_\chi
}
\]

- No particles exist in entanglement  
- No observation has occurred  
- ψ = 0 throughout the entangled phase  
- Measurement breaks χ-coherence  
- Apparent nonlocality arises from XY-only access  

Quantum entanglement is therefore a **geometric coherence condition**,  
not a mysterious physical connection, fully consistent with FFT’s  
χδ–ψ framework.
