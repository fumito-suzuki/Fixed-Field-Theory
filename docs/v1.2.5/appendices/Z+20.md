## Neutrino Oscillation as δ-Density Drift in C-Wave Propagation

In the Standard Model, neutrino oscillation is described as a quantum
superposition of mass eigenstates.  
In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), neutrinos are not mass eigenstates but:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{ultra-low-density C-waves whose δ-interference structure drifts over long propagation.}
}
\]

Thus, *“oscillation”* is not a mixing of particle identities;  
it is a **gradual reshaping of δ-density** as the C-wave interacts weakly with
the global T-field background.

# Z+20.1 Neutrinos as δ-Minimal C-Waves (Review of Z+19)

A neutrino satisfies:

- χ ≈ 0 (almost no curvature)  
- δ ≪ 1 (minimal interference density)  
- ψ ≈ 0 (no boundary formation)

Thus neutrinos propagate freely, nearly rectilinearly, and with extremely low
τ-distortion.

However, δ is **not strictly constant** during propagation.  
It changes with:

- gravitational potential of large bodies  
- density of the cosmic T-field  
- local δ of matter  
- background C-wave bath (photons, relic fields)

This slow drift in δ is the origin of **neutrino oscillation**.

# Z+20.2 δ-Density as the “Flavor Coordinate”

Each neutrino “flavor” (ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ) has a characteristic δ-band:

\[
\nu_e  \leftrightarrow \delta_1,\qquad
\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow \delta_2,\qquad
\nu_\tau\leftrightarrow \delta_3.
\]

These are **not particles** but **stable δ-profiles** available to C-waves.

Thus:

- A neutrino is not born as a flavor.
- It is born with an initial δ-spectrum.
- Propagation reshapes this δ-spectrum.
- Detection selects the δ-profile that best fits the local T-wave matter.

# Z+20.3 Propagation: δ Undergoes Adiabatic Drift

During long-distance travel, δ changes as:

\[
\frac{d\delta}{ds} = -\alpha\,\delta + \beta\,\Delta_{\text{env}}
\]

where:

- α = natural smoothing of C-wave structure  
- β = environmental coupling  
- Δ_env = δ-contrast of surrounding matter/T-field

Solutions show **oscillatory drift**:

\[
\delta(s) = \delta_0 \, e^{-\alpha s} + 
\beta \int_0^s \Delta_{\text{env}}(u)\, e^{-\alpha (s-u)} du.
\]

Because Δ_env varies periodically (cosmic density waves, galactic potentials),
δ acquires **a quasi-periodic modulation**.

This is misinterpreted in particle physics as:

> “neutrino flavor oscillation”.

# Z+20.4 Detection: Matter Selects the δ-Profile

A detector interacts only with δ-values that generate ψ:

\[
\psi_{\text{det}} = \chi_{\text{matter}}\delta.
\]

This interaction strength differs for δ₁, δ₂, δ₃ because:

- local T-wave density  
- nuclear structure  
- environmental χ-profile  

match more strongly to one δ-band than others.

Thus detection probability is:

\[
P(\delta \to \delta_i)
\propto
\|\chi_{\text{det}}\|^2 \,\delta_i^2.
\]

This reproduces:

- flavor appearance  
- flavor disappearance  
- energy dependence  
- baseline length dependence  

without invoking mass mixing.

# Z+20.5 Why Oscillation Has a Frequency

The δ-modulation frequency originates from:

1. **background T-wave curvature waves (T-wave tides)**  
2. **cosmic-scale C-wave background**  
3. **τ-phase delays accumulated over long distances**

The effective oscillation frequency is approximately:

\[
\omega_{\text{osc}} \sim 
\frac{\partial (\Delta Z)}{\partial s}
\]

since τ-lag determines δ’s stability.

This provides a purely geometric origin for neutrino oscillation.

# Z+20.6 Resonance: Why Oscillation Strength Varies by Environment

Neutrino oscillation is strongest when:

\[
\delta_{\text{env}} \approx \delta_i.
\]

This mirrors the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, but without invoking
mass:

- dense matter  
- variable T-wave curvature  
- high δ-contrast boundaries  

cause δ to drift preferentially toward one of the stable δ-bands.

This produces:

- enhanced ν_e disappearance in the Sun  
- regeneration effects  
- sharp energy dependence  
- flavor swapping at supernova density

# Z+20.7 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Neutrino oscillation = δ-density drift during C-wave propagation.}
}
\]

This explains:

- flavor mixing  
- baseline dependence  
- environmental effects  
- coherence over cosmic distances  
- oscillation frequencies

without:

- mass eigenstates  
- mixing matrices  
- flavor superpositions  
- wavefunction collapse

Neutrinos are simply **C-waves whose δ-structure slowly deforms** as they
travel through the T-field universe.
