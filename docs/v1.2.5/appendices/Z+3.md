# Appendix Z+3 — Projection Operator f and the Geometry of 2.5D Perception

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides additional mathematical and conceptual structure
supporting Section N of the main text, which discusses perception within
Fixed-Field Theory.

It clarifies why perception is not an inverse reconstruction of three-dimensional
geometry and derives the projection operator that maps T-fiber geometry onto a
2.5D perceptual space.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- χ — causal curvature injection
- δ — interference density
- ψ — information-gradient field defined by χδ
- τ — phase-time generated by interference stability

The main text states that human perception stabilizes a lower-dimensional
representation through interference delays rather than reconstructing full
three-dimensional structure.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Setup

The relevant fields are:

- $\psi(x,y,z,t)$ — generator field
- $\Psi(x,y,z,t)$ — T-fiber geometry
- $\rho(x,y,z,t)$ — effective density field
- $C(x,y,t)$ — perceptual field

The perceptual field lacks an independent Z-axis and encodes depth implicitly
through phase delay.

### 3.2 Key Equations

The generator field satisfies

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Define two Z-dependent projections acting on $\Psi$:

$$
\Pi_{XZ}[\Psi], \qquad \Pi_{YZ}[\Psi].
$$

Introduce the Z-axis delay

$$
\tau_Z = \frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}}.
$$

The perceptual field is defined by the projection operator $f$ acting on $\Psi$:

$$
C = f(\Psi).
$$

The operator $f$ is given by the composition

$$
f = \mathcal{I} \circ (\Pi_{XZ}, \Pi_{YZ}).
$$

### 3.3 Result

The interference operator $\mathcal{I}$ is defined as

$$
\mathcal{I}(A,B)(x,y,t)
=
\int
A(x,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
B(y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z)\,dz.
$$

Here, $K(z)$ is a depth-weighting kernel that peaks at the interference minimum
and suppresses unstable depth contributions.

A minimal example is

$$
K(z) = \exp(-\alpha z^2).
$$

This construction yields a perceptual space with effective dimensionality

$$
\mathrm{dim}_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2 + \varepsilon,
\qquad
\varepsilon \approx 0.5.
$$

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

This projection model is consistent with χδ geometry:

- χ injects causal curvature along the Z-axis
- δ controls interference density between projections
- ψ gradients determine perceptual stability
- τ appears as a measurable Z-delay

The mass-density relation

$$
\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2
$$

remains valid under projection.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies why depth is experienced rather than reconstructed, why
perceptual geometry is neither fully two-dimensional nor fully three-dimensional,
and why opacity arises without invoking photon absorption.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to open problems concerning perceptual dimensionality
and the role of τ in observation and stabilization.

## 7. Summary

Perception in FFT is described by a nonlinear, interference-based projection
operator acting on T-fiber geometry.

The operator $f$ produces a stabilized 2.5D perceptual space in which depth
emerges from Z-axis phase delay rather than geometric reconstruction.
