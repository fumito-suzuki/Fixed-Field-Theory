# Appendix Z+3  
## Projection Operator \( f \): Formal Derivation and the Geometry of 2.5D Perception

This appendix provides a detailed derivation of the projection operator

\[
C = f(\Psi),
\]

which maps the 3D T-fiber geometry \(\Psi(x,y,z,t)\) onto the 2.5D perceptual
field \(C(x,y,t)\). Contrary to classical visual models, FFT asserts that humans
do **not** observe the full 3D structure of reality. Instead, observation arises
from the convergence of two wave-like projections, each carrying Z-axis
temporal delays that encode apparent depth.

This generates the effective dimensionality:

\[
\text{dim}_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.5,
\]

which accounts for the spherical appearance of objects, the opacity of bodies,
and the fundamental limitations of visual reconstruction.

## Z+3.1 The Fundamental Insight:  
### *Perception is not inverse reconstruction; it is wavefront convergence.*

Standard physics assumes:

> Light from a point arrives at the retina, is inverted, and the brain “reconstructs” depth.

FFT replaces this picture with:

> Two C-wave projections (XZ-plane and YZ-plane), carrying different Z-delay
> signatures, **interfere and converge** in front of the observer, generating a
> stabilized 2.5D percept.

There is no 3D inverse solve.  
Depth is not computed; it is **felt as a stable interference minimum.**

## Z+3.2 Definition of the Projection Operator \( f \)

Let \(\Psi(x,y,z,t)\) be the T-fiber field. Define two Z-axis–dependent slices:

- XZ-slice projection: \(\Pi_{XZ}[\Psi]\)  
- YZ-slice projection: \(\Pi_{YZ}[\Psi]\)

Each projection incorporates the Z-delay:

\[
\tau_Z(x,y,z)
=
\frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}},
\]

where \(c_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is the C-wave propagation speed in the T-fiber.

Then define the perceptual field:

\[
C(x,y,t)
=
f(\Psi)
=
\mathcal{I}
\Big(
\Pi_{XZ}[\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)]
\;,\;
\Pi_{YZ}[\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)]
\Big),
\]

where \(\mathcal{I}\) denotes **interference convergence** rather than summation.

Thus:

\[
f = \mathcal{I}\circ (\Pi_{XZ},\Pi_{YZ}).
\]

The operator is:

- **nonlinear**  
- **phase-sensitive**  
- **Z-axis–dependent**  
- **bi-projection-based**

## Z+3.3 Mathematical Form of the Interference Operator \( \mathcal{I} \)

Given two projected fields:

\[
A(x,z,t) = \Pi_{XZ}[\Psi], \qquad
B(y,z,t) = \Pi_{YZ}[\Psi],
\]

define:

\[
\mathcal{I}(A,B)(x,y,t)
=
\int dz\;
A(x,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
B(y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z),
\]

where \(K(z)\) is a depth-weighting kernel:

- peaked around the interference minimum  
- decays for large |z|  
- ensures perceptual stability  

A simple choice:

\[
K(z) = \exp\!\left(-\alpha z^2\right),
\]

but FFT does not assume Gaussianity; the kernel shape determines the visual
“style” of perception across species.

## Z+3.4 Why this produces **2.5 dimensions**

The percept \(C(x,y,t)\):

- has two spatial axes (x,y)  
- but implicitly encodes Z via *delay signatures*  
- yet cannot reconstruct Z independently  

So:

- not 2D (depth is encoded)  
- not 3D (Z cannot be freely rotated or inspected)

This motivates the effective dimensionality:

\[
\dim_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2 + \epsilon,
\qquad \epsilon \approx 0.5.
\]

This value emerges naturally from the two-projection interference model.

---

## Z+3.5 Why objects appear spherical  
### (The visual sphere theorem)

Regardless of the true geometry of an object, the interference condition:

\[
A(x,z_1)B(y,z_1) = A(x,z_2)B(y,z_2)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\text{perceptual equivalence},
\]

produces iso-depth surfaces that are level sets of \(\tau_Z\), hence spheres.

Thus the reason:

- planets  
- faces  
- fruits  
- glass lenses  

all appear spherical is because **depth = constant Z-delay**, which is
spherically symmetric around the observer.

This connects directly to Appendix Z+11 (τ = const surfaces are spheres).

---

## Z+3.6 Why we cannot see behind objects  
### (Z-delay occlusion principle)

Let \(z_a < z_b\).  
If the nearer object produces C-wave interference that stabilizes earlier, then:

\[
C_a(x,y,t) \prec C_b(x,y,t+\Delta\tau),
\]

so the percept from B never forms, regardless of Ψ.

This explains opacity without invoking photon absorption:

- behind-object information exists in Ψ  
- but cannot form a stable interference minimum  

which matches biological perception without contradicting FFT physics.

## Z+3.7 Formal Kernel Expression (Compact Version)

For direct citation:

\[
f(\Psi)(x,y,t)
=
\int dz\; 
\Pi_{XZ}\Psi(x,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
\Pi_{YZ}\Psi(y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z).
\]

where:

- \(K(z)\): depth kernel  
- \(\tau_Z = z/c_{\mathrm{eff}}\): Z-delay  
- \(c_{\mathrm{eff}}\): effective propagation velocity of C-waves  

This is the **minimal mathematical definition of perception in FFT**.

---

## Z+3.8 Why FFT perception is fundamentally different from optics

Classical optics:

- assumes straight-line photons  
- depth from stereopsis or inference  
- ignores internal causal delays in χ

FFT:

- depth originates from **Z-axis phase delay**  
- photon picture is replaced by C-wave interference  
- perception is *a physical projection of a field*, not a reconstruction

Thus FFT perception is closer to holography with missing phases than to
geometric optics.

## Z+3.9 Summary

The projection operator \(f\):

- is nonlinear and interference-based  
- maps T-fiber geometry to 2.5D percepts  
- explains spherical appearances  
- accounts for opacity  
- yields depth from Z-delay  
- requires no 3D reconstruction  
- is consistent with FFT cosmology and consciousness models

In FFT, perception is not a passive imaging process but an **active convergence
of wavefronts**, producing a stable representation of the world from Ψ.
