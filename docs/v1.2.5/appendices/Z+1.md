# Appendix Z+1 — The Sora Equation

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5 Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides the full analytical and conceptual structure of the
**Sora Equation**, which governs the evolution of the observable generator field
$\psi = \chi\delta$ introduced in **Section 4 (観測層の幾何)** of the main text.

The goals are to:

- clarify why ψ is not a physical field but an **appearance field**,
- derive the Sora Equation from χδ geometry,
- connect χ, δ, ψ, and τ to perceptual and quantum behavior,
- extend Section 4 by describing nonlinear edge formation, diffusion,
  and the emergence of quantum mechanics in the small-curvature limit.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- **χ** — causal curvature injection (Z-depth → τ conversion),
- **δ** — interference density on delayed planes $XτZ, YτZ$,
- **ψ = χδ** — observable generator field governing appearance,
- **τ** — phase-time generated by interference stability.

The main text states:

> *ψ は実体ではなく、観測時に C-wave 上で生成される「見え方」である。  
> その時間発展が Sora 方程式で与えられる。*

This appendix formalizes that statement and derives its mathematical form.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Setup

Define the fields used in this appendix:

- $\psi(x,y,z,t)$ — observable generator,
- $\Psi(x,y,z,t)$ — T-fiber (real field),
- $\rho(x,y,z,t)$ — information density,
- $C(x,y,t)$ — C-wave projection field.

### 3.2 Key Equations

The generator field satisfies

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The Sora Equation provides its evolution:

$$
\partial_t \psi =
\omega_0' +
D\Delta\psi +
\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2 +
\xi.
$$

Here:

- $\omega_0'$ — baseline winding rate (atomic-clock determinant),
- $D\Delta\psi$ — diffusive smoothing,
- $\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2$ — nonlinear steepening (edge formation),
- $\xi$ — stochastic input from unresolved microstructure.

### 3.3 Result

The Sora Equation emerges from the coarse-grained evolution of χ and δ:

- χ varies through Z-depth reconfiguration,
- δ varies through C-wave interference shifts,
- $\psi = \chi\delta$ inherits both variations.

Under space–time averaging, these produce:

- a diffusion term ($D\Delta\psi$),
- a nonlinear concentration term ($\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2$),
- a noise term ($\xi$),
- a constant drift ($\omega_0'$).

Geometrically:

- diffusion yields **blurring**,
- nonlinear steepening yields **edges**,
- noise seeds **micro-texture**,
- $\omega_0'$ enforces minimal temporal stratification of τ.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The derivation clarifies the following:

- χ–δ coupling produces ψ as an **appearance** field,
- gradients of ψ encode contrast, boundary, and refraction strength,
- Z-delay and τ determine the domain of δ and thus ψ,
- mass-like density satisfies $\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2$,
  linking perception to structure formation.

Thus ψ is an emergent geometric signal shaped entirely by χδ interactions,
not an independent physical substance.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines Section 4 by showing that:

- **quantum behavior** arises from the small-curvature limit of Sora,
- **perceptual geometry** (edges, contrast, shading) follows from
  $\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2$,
- **cosmology** inherits structure via $\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2$,
- **consciousness** interacts with ψ through τ-controlled projection (Section 7).

Example wording:

> These results demonstrate that the phenomenon described in Section 4
> is a direct consequence of the χδ interaction under the Sora Equation
> with the given boundary conditions.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to the following open problems:

- **8.1** — emergence of quantum potential in χδ geometry,
- **8.3** — nonlinear structure formation across perceptual and cosmic scales,
- **8.5** — stability of τ under noise ξ and its role in consciousness,
- **8.7** — relationship between T-wave densities and ψ gradient dynamics.

These connections ensure the Sora Equation is integrated into ongoing FFT development.

## 7. Summary

Key points:

- $\psi = \chi\delta$ is an **appearance field**, not a physical field,
- its time evolution is governed by the Sora Equation,
- diffusion smooths ψ while nonlinear steepening sharpens ψ,
- quantum mechanics emerges as the **linearized limit** of Sora,
- structure formation and perceptual geometry arise from $\|\nabla\psi\|^2$.

This appendix strengthens the mathematical foundation of Section 4
and formalizes the role of Sora dynamics within the broader χδ–ψ geometry of FFT.
