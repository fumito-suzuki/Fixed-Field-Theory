# Appendix Z+37B  
## Why the Observable Universe Must Appear Spherical  
### τ-Isosurfaces and the Geometric Necessity of Spherical Observation in FFT

This appendix explains why every observer in Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) perceives
the universe as **spherically symmetric**, regardless of the true global
structure. This includes:

- the spherical Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
- isotropy of large-scale structure,
- the apparent “centeredness” of each observer,
- equal-radius horizons in every direction.

In FFT, this is not a coincidence nor a cosmological principle.  
It is a **geometric inevitability** arising from the nature of the emergent
phase-time τ and the causal structure of the T-fiber.

## Z+37B.1 Phase-Time τ and Its Gradient ∇τ

Time in FFT does not exist fundamentally; it emerges as **phase-time** τ, defined
by local stability of T-wave interference patterns.

$$
\tau = \tau[\Psi]
$$

Its gradient determines the “direction of becoming”:

$$
\vec{n}_\tau \equiv \nabla \tau.
$$

Key fact:

> **Values of τ with equal phase define closed 2D hypersurfaces around the 
> observer.**

These are **τ-isosurfaces**, and all observation is restricted to intersections
of:

- C-wave projections (optical reception)
- T-fiber causal thickness
- τ-isosurfaces

## Z+37B.2 Why τ-Isosurfaces Are Necessarily Spherical

Let τ satisfy:

$$
\partial_t \tau = \omega_0' + \varepsilon(\nabla\psi),
$$

with isotropic leading term ω₀′.

Since τ is produced by scalar diffusion over an effectively isotropic medium
(T-fiber), its equal-phase surfaces satisfy:

$$
\nabla^2 \tau = 0.
$$

Solutions to Laplace’s equation in 3D, under regularity and finite-energy
conditions, are:

$$
\tau(r) = A + \frac{B}{r}.
$$

Thus, the level sets:

$$
\tau(r) = \text{constant}
$$

are **spheres**.

> **Spherical τ-isosurfaces are the only non-singular global solutions.**

This is an incredibly strong conclusion:

### → 宇宙がどういう形でも、  
### → 観測者がどこにいても、  
### → 観測可能範囲は必ず球になる。

## Z+37B.3 Light Propagation and τ-Isosurfaces

All C-wave (light) reception occurs along paths:

$$
C = f(\Psi),
$$

and photons correspond to **C-wave packets traveling along τ-gradients**.

Arrival time = value of τ at the observer.

Therefore:

- equal-arrival-time surfaces  
- equal-τ surfaces  
- observable horizons  

are all identical.

Thus:

> **The CMB surface = τ(last scattering) = perfect sphere around every observer.**

This matches cosmological observations *exactly*.

## Z+37B.4 Why the Universe Looks Like It Has a Center (But Does Not)

Because τ-isosurfaces are spheres centered on the observer's worldline.

Let the observer be at point O:

$$
\{ x : \tau(x) = \tau_0 - \Delta\tau \}
$$

is a sphere centered at O.

But another observer O′ has their own τ with level sets centered at O′.

Thus each observer sees:

- themselves at the “center”  
- the universe as radially symmetric  

without implying anything about global topology.

This resolves the long-standing philosophical confusion:  
**We are not special. The geometry forces this illusion.**

## Z+37B.5 FFT Explanation of the Isotropy of the CMB

In ΛCDM, the isotropy of the CMB is taken as an empirical fact, explained by
inflation.

FFT instead provides a pure geometric explanation:

$$
\text{CMB isotropy} = \text{spherical τ-isosurfaces with constant thickness}.
$$

No inflation required.

Small anisotropies (10⁻⁵) arise from:

- χ-residual curvature (Z+6)  
- ψ-divergence fluctuations (Z+7)  
- T-fiber thickness modulation  

---

## Z+37B.6 Why the Observable Universe Has a Sharp Horizon

The causal reach of an observer is limited by points with equal τ reachable by
C-wave propagation.

Since:

- τ-isosurfaces are compact spheres  
- C-wave propagation occurs along ∇τ  

the horizon is:

- spherical  
- finite  
- observer-centered  
- inevitable in FFT geometry

This perfectly reproduces the:

- particle horizon  
- event horizon  
- CMB last-scattering surface

## Z+37B.7 Distinction from Z+11 (Perception Geometry)

Z+11 explains why *objects* appear as spheres or have spherical occlusion.

Z+37B explains why the **entire universe** appears spherical.

Difference:

| Appendix | Scale | Cause |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Z+11 | Local perception | 2.5D projection geometry |
| Z+37B | Cosmological | τ-isosurfaces from T-fiber dynamics |

Both are needed; neither replaces the other.

## Z+37B.8 Summary

In FFT:

### ✔ τ-isosurfaces are necessarily spheres  
(because τ satisfies Laplace-like equations)

### ✔ All optical observation occurs along τ-gradients  
(C-wave reception)

### ✔ Therefore the observable universe must appear spherical  
(CMB, galaxy distribution, horizons)

### ✔ Each observer sees themselves at the center  
(illusion caused by τ-geometry)

### ✔ Isotropy requires no inflation  
(geometric consequence of T-fiber)

### ✔ Global topology is irrelevant  
(only τ-level sets matter)

> **We do not observe the universe as spherical.  
It can *only* appear spherical.**
