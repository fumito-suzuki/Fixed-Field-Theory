# Appendix Z+1 — The Sora Equation  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5 Supplemental Material)*  

## 1. Purpose and Scope  
This appendix provides the full analytical and conceptual structure of the  
**Sora Equation**, which governs the evolution of the observable generator field  
`ψ = χδ` introduced in **Section 4 (観測層の幾何)** of the main text.

The goals are to:

- clarify why ψ is *not* a physical field but an **appearance field**  
- derive the Sora Equation from χδ geometry  
- connect χ, δ, ψ, τ to perceptual and quantum behavior  
- extend Section 4 by describing nonlinear edge-formation, diffusion,  
  and the emergence of quantum mechanics in the small-curvature limit

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)  
Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- **χ** — causal curvature injection (Z-depth → τ conversion)  
- **δ** — interference density on delayed planes \(XτZ, YτZ\)  
- **ψ = χδ** — observable generator field governing appearance  
- **τ** — phase-time generated by interference stability  

The main text states:

> *ψ は実体ではなく、観測時に C-wave 上で生成される「見え方」である。  
>  その時間発展が Sora 方程式で与えられる。*

This appendix formalizes that statement and derives its mathematical form.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model  

### 3.1 Setup  
Define the fields used in this appendix:

- `ψ(x,y,z,t)` — observable generator  
- `Ψ(x,y,z,t)` — T-fiber (real field)  
- `ρ(x,y,z,t)` — information density  
- `C(x,y,t)` — C-wave projection field  

### 3.2 Key Equations  
The generator field satisfies  
`ψ = χ δ`.

The Sora Equation provides its evolution:  
`∂_t ψ = ω₀' + DΔψ + κ‖∇ψ‖² + ξ`.

Here:

- `ω₀'` — baseline winding rate (atomic-clock determinant)  
- `DΔψ` — diffusive smoothing  
- `κ‖∇ψ‖²` — nonlinear steepening (edge formation)  
- `ξ` — stochastic input from unresolved microstructure  

### 3.3 Result  
The Sora Equation emerges from the coarse-grained evolution of χ and δ:

- χ varies through Z-depth reconfiguration  
- δ varies through C-wave interference shifts  
- ψ = χδ inherits both variations  

Under space–time averaging, these produce:

- a diffusion term (`DΔψ`)  
- a nonlinear concentration term (`κ‖∇ψ‖²`)  
- a noise term (`ξ`)  
- a constant drift (`ω₀'`)

Geometrically:

- diffusion yields **blurring**  
- nonlinear steepening yields **edges**  
- noise seeds **micro-texture**  
- ω₀' enforces **minimal temporal stratification** of τ

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry  
The derivation clarifies the following:

- χ–δ coupling produces ψ as an **appearance** field  
- gradients of ψ encode **contrast, boundary, and refraction strength**  
- Z-delay and τ determine the domain of δ and thus ψ  
- mass-like density satisfies `ρ_T ∝ ‖∇ψ‖²`, linking perception to structure formation  

Thus ψ is an emergent geometric signal shaped entirely by χδ interactions, not an independent physical substance.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections  
This appendix refines Section 4 by showing that:

- **quantum behavior** arises from the small-curvature limit of Sora  
- **perceptual geometry** (edges, contrast, shading) follows from κ‖∇ψ‖²  
- **cosmology** inherits structure via `ρ_T ∝ ‖∇ψ‖²`  
- **consciousness** interacts with ψ through τ-controlled projection (Section 7)  

Example wording:

> These results demonstrate that the phenomenon described in Section 4  
> is a direct consequence of the χδ interaction under the Sora Equation  
> with the given boundary conditions.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)  
This appendix contributes to the following open problems:

- **8.1** — emergence of quantum potential in χδ geometry  
- **8.3** — nonlinear structure formation across perceptual and cosmic scales  
- **8.5** — stability of τ under noise ξ and its role in consciousness  
- **8.7** — relationship between T-wave densities and ψ gradient dynamics  

These connections ensure the Sora Equation is integrated into ongoing FFT development.

## 7. Summary  
Key points:

- ψ = χδ is an **appearance field**, not a physical field.  
- Its time evolution is governed by the Sora Equation.  
- Diffusion smooths ψ; nonlinear steepening sharpens ψ.  
- Quantum mechanics emerges as the **linearized limit** of Sora.  
- Structure formation and perceptual geometry arise from `‖∇ψ‖²`.  

This appendix strengthens the mathematical foundation of Section 4  
and formalizes the role of Sora dynamics within the broader χδ–ψ geometry of FFT.
