# Fixed-Field-Theory v1.2.4

## Abstract

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) proposes a unified geometric framework in which
quantum mechanics, cosmology, and perceptual phenomena emerge from a single
continuous fractal causal field, the T-fiber.
Two complementary waveforms—the continuous T-wave and the discrete,
receptor-dependent C-wave—interact through a fundamental operation

$$
\chi\delta \qquad (\text{entangle–expand}),
$$

a mathematical representation of the classical identity
色即是空・空即是色 (“Form is emptiness; emptiness is form”).

We introduce a minimal dynamical system consisting of three equations:
	1.	FFT-1: the nonlinear fractal fixed-field equation
	2.	FFT-2: the continuity equation for information density
	3.	FFT-3: the C-wave evolution projected onto the XY-plane (observer geometry)

From these equations we derive:
	•	The Planck constant as a geometric ratio of T-fiber fractal parameters
	•	Newton’s gravitational constant G from T-fiber curvature and χδ dynamics
	•	The cosmological constant \lambda as an emergent drift of global tension
	•	Quantum entanglement, collapse, and decoherence as Z-axis alignment dynamics
	•	The 2.5D structure of perception arising from dual-plane C-wave projection
	•	Dark matter and dark energy as geometric consequences of tension variation

FFT offers explanations for major physical phenomena without introducing new particles,
and provides a consistent mathematical architecture connecting physics, cognition,
and cosmology.


## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Modern physics consists of two extraordinarily successful yet conceptually
disconnected theories:
	•	Quantum mechanics, describing the small
	•	General relativity, describing the large

Between them lies a structural incompatibility:
	•	QM is fundamentally linear and operator-based
	•	GR is nonlinear and geometric

Furthermore, neither theory accounts for:
	•	The structure of perception
	•	The emergence of temporal order
	•	The stability of causal direction
	•	The relationship between information and geometry

Attempts at unification—string theory, loop quantum gravity, causal sets,
holography—each capture important aspects, yet rely on strong assumptions:
	•	Discrete lattices
	•	Higher-dimensional manifolds
	•	New particles or new symmetries
	•	Background dependence

FFT takes a different route:
postulating a single geometric substrate from which all known physics emerges.

### 1.2 Core Idea of Fixed-Field Theory

FFT posits that physical reality is supported by a continuous fractal causal field
called the T-fiber.

Key properties:
	•	It is not a lattice
	•	It is continuous, but fractal in the Z-direction (τ-time direction)
	•	It accumulates causal influence (“stacking”)
	•	Its local phase alignment produces what is perceived as time’s solidity
	•	Disturbances propagate as T-waves

The observable universe arises not from the T-fiber alone, but from its
interaction with a complementary mode:
	•	The C-wave, representing receptor-dependent, concept-forming interference
	•	All observation occurs via C-wave projection onto the XY-plane
	•	Two C-wave projections (XZ, YZ) fuse into the 2.5D perceptual world

The interaction between T and C is encoded by:

$$
\chi : \text{causal accumulation along Z},\quad
\delta : \text{interference density on XY},
$$

and the unified expression

$$$
\psi = \chi\delta
$$

generates the information-density gradient from which physical laws derive.

### 1.3 What FFT Is — and Is Not

FFT is:
	•	A geometric unification framework, not a particle theory
	•	A continuous (non-lattice) field theory
	•	A fractal time-direction geometry, not discrete time
	•	A deterministic field evolution with observer-dependent projections
	•	A theory in which QM emerges rather than being postulated

FFT is not:
	•	A metaphysical claim (“everything is vibration”)
	•	A simulation hypothesis
	•	A claim that the universe is literally 2D
	•	A replacement for empirical physics
	•	A discrete lattice model

These clarifications address common misunderstandings (AI models included)
and ensure FFT is interpreted within its proper mathematical scope.

### 1.4 Contributions of This Work

This paper provides:

#### (1) A minimal dynamical system

Three equations (FFT-1–3) forming the backbone of all FFT dynamics.

#### (2) A geometric derivation of physical constants

$$
Including \hbar, G, and \lambda.
$$

#### (3) A unified account of quantum phenomena
- entanglement = Z-axis misalignment
- teleportation = Z-axis realignment
- collapse = minimization of Z-variance
- decoherence = divergence of Z-variance

#### (4) A geometric perception model

Explaining depth, shadow, spherical appearance, and 2.5D observation.

#### (5) A cosmological model without dark-sector particles

Dark matter/energy arise from T-fiber tension variations.

#### (6) A mathematical model of consciousness

$$
\text{Consciousness} = \mathcal{G}\circ \Pi_{XY}
$$

## 2. Foundations of Fixed-Field Geometry

The Fixed-Field Theory is built upon a continuous fractal causal substrate,
the T-fiber, and its interaction with a complementary interference field,
the C-wave.
This section formalizes their mathematical structure, clarifies their physical roles,
and derives the core composite quantity:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta .
$$

This ψ-field will later generate the information density ρ and govern all observable
dynamics through FFT-1〜3.

### 2.1 The T-fiber: A Continuous Fractal Causal Field

#### 2.1.1 Definition

The T-fiber is defined as a continuous field
T(x,y,z,t)
that encodes the accumulation of causal influence along a preferred direction
denoted by z or $\tau$ (phase-time).

Its essential properties are:

##### (A) Continuity

T-fiber is not a lattice.
There is no discretization of spacetime.
Instead it is modeled as a continuous differentiable field, except where
fractal scaling induces non-integer differentiation orders.

##### (B) Fractality along Z (τ-time)

Although continuous, T exhibits self-similar scaling in the Z-direction:

$$
T(x, y, \lambda z, t) \sim \lambda^{D} T(x, y, z, t),
$$

with fractal dimension D satisfying 1 < D < 3.

##### (C) Causal stacking

At each spatial point (x,y), T-fiber “accumulates” causal influence:

$$
\partial_t T = \chi(x,y,t) + \text{wave terms}.
$$

The quantity $\chi$ represents causal accumulation rate.

##### (D) Phase alignment produces emergent time

When local regions of T-fiber satisfy:

$$
\partial_z T \approx \text{const.},
$$

their evolution yields a stable temporal ordering, experienced phenomenologically
as “the flow of time”.

This motivates the definition:

Definition: τ-time (phase-time)

$$
\tau(x,y,z,t) = \text{local phase of } T(x,y,z,t).
$$

Time in FFT is not a fundamental dimension but an emergent ordering resulting from
local phase alignment in the T-fiber.

### 2.2 The C-wave: Receptor-Dependent Conceptual Interference

#### 2.2.1 Physical meaning

C-wave is the mathematical representation of:
- measurement
- perception
- conceptual structure
- information extraction

and corresponds to the observer-dependent component of reality.

Unlike T-wave (continuous), C-wave is receptor-based:
it exists only when there is a system capable of absorbing or transducing the wave
(eye, sensor, molecule, etc.).

Thus:
- Sound is T-wave → C-wave (pressure → cochlea)
- Light is T-wave → C-wave（electromagnetic → retina）
- Smell, taste, touch also arise through receptor-triggered C-wave fields

#### 2.2.2 Mathematical definition

$$
C(x,y,t)
$$

is defined on the observer’s XY-plane projection, obtained via:

$$
C = \Pi_{XY}[\text{TC-wave interference}].
$$

C is not defined along Z; instead, Z-depth enters via delayed phase
(important later in Section 4).

### 2.3 χ and δ: The Fundamental Operators

FFT introduces two primitive geometric quantities.

#### 2.3.1 χ — Causal Accumulation

$$
\chi(x,y,t) = \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}.
$$

This measures how much causal tension accumulates along the T-fiber at location (x,y).

Physical meaning:
- high χ → dense causal history
- low χ → “thin” causal structure

#### 2.3.2 δ — Interference Density

δ quantifies how C-wave interference modifies accessible information in the XY-plane:

$$
\delta = |\nabla C|^2 \quad \text{or generalized forms}.
$$

Physical meaning:
- high δ → strong perceptual influence
- δ = 0 → no observation / no measurement

δ captures everything from visual edges to conceptual gradients.

### 2.4 ψ = χδ: The Unified Information-Gradient Field

The central unifying quantity in FFT is:

$$
\boxed{\psi(x,y,t) = \chi(x,y,t)\, \delta(x,y,t)}.
$$

Why multiply?
- χ gives causal depth
- δ gives informational contrast

Their product yields how strongly information propagates into T-fiber structure.

This ψ-field appears in:
- FFT-1 (nonlinear term)
- FFT-2 (continuity equation source)
- FFT-3 (C-wave projection dynamics)
- entanglement geometry
- cosmological curvature
- free will / consciousness

### 2.5 Information Density ρ and Its Relation to ψ

FFT defines information density ρ via:

$$
\partial_t \rho = \beta_1 \|\nabla \psi\|^2 + \beta_2 \|\nabla C\|^2 - \gamma\rho.
$$

Interpretation:
- ψ-gradients increase ρ（self-organization）
- C-wave gradients reinforce ρ（perception → structure）
- $\gamma$ controls dissipation

ρ is not “mass density” but informational tension density,
yet mass emerges from ρ in specific limits (shown in Section 5 and 6).

### 2.6 Summary of Section 2

We have introduced:

| Symbol | Meaning | Domain | Notes |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| T |	T-fiber causal field | 3D + τ |	continuous, fractal |
| C |	C-wave conceptual field |	XY-plane | receptor-dependent |
| χ | causal accumulation | derivative along Z | gives depth |
| δ | C-wave interference density | XY-plane | gives contrast |
| ψ | χδ | XY-plane → T-fiber | unified info gradient |
| ρ | information density |	3D | mass/structure precursor |
| τ | emergent time | from phase alignment | not primary |

This geometric structure forms the backbone from which all later physics will emerge.

# 3. Minimal Dynamics of the Fixed Field

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) is governed by a minimal set of three coupled dynamical
equations describing the evolution of:

- the **T-fiber field** $\(\Psi\)$,
- the **information density** $\(\rho\)$,
- the **C-wave field** $\(C\)$.

These equations form a **closed dynamical loop**:

$$
C \rightarrow \delta \rightarrow \psi \rightarrow \rho 
\rightarrow \chi \rightarrow \Psi \rightarrow C.
$$

This loop expresses the core idea of FFT:  
**observation, information, and causal geometry mutually generate one another.**

## 3.1 FFT-1 — Nonlinear Fractal Fixed-Field Equation

The fundamental dynamical equation for the T-fiber field $\(\Psi\)$ is:

$$
\boxed{
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}} \Psi = 0
}
\tag{FFT-1}
$$

The operator $\(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}}\)$ is defined as:

$$
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}}=
i\hbar \partial_t+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\left(
\Delta + \ell_D^{\,2-D}\,\Delta^D
\right)- \hbar\left(
c_1 \partial_z + c_2 \partial_\theta + c_3 \partial_{\log r}
\right)- \left(
V + \mathcal{N}[\Psi;\rho,C] + \mathcal{J}[\rho,C]
\right).
$$

### Interpretation of Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| $\(i\hbar\partial_t\)$ | phase-time evolution of the T-fiber |
| $\(\Delta\)$ | standard spatial dispersion |
| $\(\Delta^D\)$ | fractal dispersion (T-fiber self-similarity) |
| drift terms | geometric rearrangement driven by \(\chi, \delta\) |
| $\(V\)$ | potential or geometric background |
| $\(\mathcal{N}\)$ | nonlinear self-organization via \(\psi\) |
| $(\mathcal{J}\)$ | information-response term from \(C\) and \(\rho\) |

FFT-1 is not a quantum wave equation on spacetime.  
It is a **self-organizing field equation for spacetime’s causal substrate**.

## 3.2 FFT-2 — Information-Density Continuity Equation

Information density $\(\rho\)$ evolves according to:

$$
\boxed{
\partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} + \mathcal{S}_\rho = 0
}
\tag{FFT-2}
$$

where the information current $\(\mathbf{J}\)$ consists of:

$$
\mathbf{J}=
\frac{\hbar}{2mi}
\left(
\Psi^\*\nabla\Psi - \Psi\nabla\Psi^\*
\right)
+
\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\,
\ell_D^{\,2-D}
\left(
\Psi^\*\nabla^{D}\Psi - \Psi\nabla^{D}\Psi^\*
\right)
+
\rho\,\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{geo}}.
$$

The source term:

$$
\mathcal{S}_\rho=
\frac{2}{\hbar}\,
\Im\big[
\Psi^\*(\mathcal{N}+\mathcal{J})\Psi
\big].
$$

### Physical Meaning

- $\(\mathcal{S}_\rho > 0\)$: self-amplification (structure formation)  
- $\(\mathcal{S}_\rho < 0\)$: dissipation  
- fractal currents encode non-integer dimensional flow  
- geometric drift reflects changes driven by $\(\chi\)$ and $\(\delta\)$

In FFT, **mass is a derived phenomenon**, emerging from $\(\rho\)$ under specific limits.

## 3.3 FFT-3 — Projected C-wave Dynamics (Observer Equation)

Observation arises from the XY-plane projection of T-fiber dynamics.  
The C-wave evolves according to:

$$
\boxed{
i\hbar \partial_t C=
\Pi_{XY}
\big[
(V + \mathcal{N}[\Psi;\rho,C] + \mathcal{J}[\rho,C])\Psi
\big]
}
\tag{FFT-3}
$$

where $\(\Pi_{XY}\)$ removes Z-depth and extracts the observable component.

### Interpretation

- $\(C\)$ is the **observer’s accessible field**, not the full T-fiber.  
- Collapse occurs when $\(C\)$ becomes a fixed point of FFT-3.  
- Decoherence corresponds to unbounded growth of Z-axis variance in $\(\Psi\)$.  
- 2.5D perception arises because observers access only $\(\Pi_{XY}(\Psi)\)$,  
  not its Z-structure.

## 3.4 Interdependence of FFT-1, FFT-2, FFT-3 (Closed Loop)

The three equations form a mutually reinforcing cycle:

1. **C-wave** determines interference density $\(\delta\)$.  
2. With $\(\chi\)$, this yields the information gradient $\(\psi = \chi\delta\)$.  
3. $\(\psi\)$ drives changes in **information density** $\(\rho\)$ (FFT-2).  
4. $\(\rho\)$ alters **T-fiber geometry** (FFT-1).  
5. T-fiber geometry determines the evolution of **C-wave** (FFT-3).

This establishes **self-organizing causality** without requiring  
external measurement postulates.

## 3.5 Summary

| Equation | Governs | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| **FFT-1** | $\(\Psi\)$ | causal geometry & fractal dynamics |
| **FFT-2** | $\(\rho\)$ | information flow & mass precursor |
| **FFT-3** | $\(C\)$ | observer projection & measurement |

Together they describe:

- structure formation  
- quantum behavior  
- perceptual geometry  
- cosmological dynamics  
- consciousness and free will (later sections)

They form the mathematical backbone of FFT.
