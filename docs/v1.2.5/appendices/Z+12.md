# Appendix Z+12 — Physical Observables of the C-wave in Fixed-Field Theory

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix clarifies **what is physically observable in Fixed-Field Theory
(FFT)**, with particular focus on the **C-wave (interference field)**.

FFT distinguishes three ontological layers:

- **T-wave (χ)** — causal field / matter itself,
- **C-wave (δ)** — interference field / information,
- **ψ** — generated phenomenon (appearance, geometry).

The purpose of this appendix is to:

- specify which quantities associated with the C-wave are observable,
- distinguish observation from generation,
- prevent category errors between C-wave, T-wave, and ψ,
- fix the operational meaning required to interpret Sections 3–5 correctly.

This appendix introduces no new dynamics.
It formalizes observational distinctions already used throughout FFT.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Fixed-Field Theory is founded on the χδ principle:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Here:

- χ encodes causal curvature carried by the T-wave,
- δ encodes interference density carried by the C-wave,
- ψ is the **appearance field** generated when interference is received by matter.

A central principle of FFT is:

> **ψ is not observed directly.  
> ψ is generated as the mode in which reality appears.**

This appendix clarifies what *is* observable prior to ψ-generation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Ontological Separation of the Three Layers

FFT strictly separates the roles of the three layers.

#### (1) T-wave — Matter Layer

The T-wave is the causal substrate of reality.

It includes:

- atoms, molecules, solids, fluids,
- biological receptors (retina, cochlea, skin),
- mechanical vibration and sound,
- thermal motion.

The T-wave exists and evolves independently of observation.

#### (2) C-wave — Information Layer

The C-wave is a directional interference field.

It includes:

- electromagnetic radiation (light, IR, radio, X-ray),
- refractive and dispersive propagation,
- superposition and interference phenomena.

The defining constraint is:

$$
\chi_{\text{C-wave}} = 0.
$$

C-waves carry **no causal curvature**.
They cannot constitute events without a T-wave receptor.

#### (3) ψ — Generated Phenomenon

The appearance field ψ satisfies:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

ψ represents:

- visible surfaces and boundaries,
- edges, contours, shading,
- apparent depth and occlusion,
- stable perceptual geometry.

ψ does not propagate, has no intrinsic frequency, and does not exist
independently.
It is generated only when C-wave interference is received by T-wave matter.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The χδ structure enforces a strict observational hierarchy:

- χ grounds causal persistence,
- δ provides interference information,
- ψ stabilizes what appears.

Only δ-related quantities are directly measurable prior to ψ-generation.
χ and ψ enter observation only through inference or generation.

This separation ensures consistency with projection geometry and the
mass-density relation:

$$
\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2.
$$

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix fixes interpretations used throughout the main text:

- **Section 3 (Observation):** measurement accesses C-wave quantities only.
- **Section 4 (Perception):** ψ is generated, not detected.
- **Section 5 (Quantum phenomena):** observables correspond to interference,
  not causal curvature.
- **Section 6 (Cosmology):** χ-curvature and ψ-gradients are inferred,
  not directly observed.

Confusing ψ with an observable field breaks the logical structure of FFT.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

The distinctions clarified here are required for:

- **8.1** — rigorous definition of the projection operator $f$,
- **8.3** — experimental detection of C-wave observables,
- **8.4** — separation of quantum observables from χδ geometry,
- **8.9** — interpretation of τ as inferred phase-time,
- **8.10** — conditions for consciousness without observer-dependent physics.

## 7. Summary

In Fixed-Field Theory:

- **T-wave (χ)** is matter and causal history,
- **C-wave (δ)** is information and interference,
- **ψ** is generated phenomenon, not an observable entity.

The **only physically observable quantities of the C-wave** are:

$$
\boxed{
\{
|C|^2,\;
\omega_C,\;
\nabla C,\;
\text{interference-derived phase differences}
\}
}
$$

ψ is not measured.
Reality is experienced **as ψ**, generated when information is received by matter.

This appendix fixes the observational boundary conditions required for FFT to
remain internally consistent across physics, perception, and cosmology.
