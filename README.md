# 🌌 Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)
*A unified geometric field theory connecting quantum mechanics, cosmology, and perception.*

**Version:** v1.2.5.x  

FFT is a unified geometric framework in which known physics appears as
a **special, narrow–view limit** of a broader geometric structure.

---

## Overview

**Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)** proposes that physical, cognitive, and cosmological
phenomena all emerge from a single geometric substrate:

- **T-fiber** — a continuous, fractal causal field  

with two interacting modes:

- **T-wave** — continuous causal propagation  
- **C-wave** — receptor-dependent, delayed projection (observation mode)

Their interaction is summarized as:

$$
\chi \delta \quad (\text{entangle–expand})
$$

This reflects the classical Buddhist identity:

> **色即是空・空即是色**  
> *Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.*

From this geometric mechanism, FFT derives — without introducing new particles:

- Planck constant  
- Newtonian gravitational constant  
- Cosmological constant λ  
- Quantum entanglement, collapse, decoherence  
- 2.5D perception geometry  
- Dark matter / dark energy  
- Emergent time (τ-time)

## ⚠️ Interpretation Notes (Important)

FFT uses unconventional language.  
The following clarifications prevent common misreadings.

### 1. “Zero-dimensional origin”
This does **not** mean the universe is physically 0D.  
It refers to an **informational basepoint** — a topological origin from which
T-fiber geometry unfolds.

---

### 2. “The world is 2D”
Physical space is **not** two-dimensional.

FFT states:

- Physical dynamics occur in 3D within the T-fiber  
- Observation appears as a **2.5D projection**:
  - XY-plane: observable surface  
  - Z-axis: causal delay (past-depth)

---

### 3. “Everything is wave”
This is not metaphysical.

All observable structures are described as **solutions of PDEs** involving:

- T-wave (continuous causal field)  
- C-wave (measurement / receptor-dependent mode)

No mystical energy waves or speculative particles are introduced.

---

### 4. “Time is solid”
“Solid” refers to **phase alignment stability** along τ.

- T-fiber is not a lattice  
- It is continuous and fractal  
- Local phase fixation creates the *appearance* of solidity

---

### 5. “Matter is fluid”
Matter is modeled as **information-density flow** arising from ψ-gradients.

This is a continuum description, not a literal fluid.

---

### 6. “Reality emerges from T/C-wave interaction”
This is a geometric statement, not idealism or simulation theory.

Observable structure arises from interaction between
continuous (T) and discrete (C) modes.

## 🚨 How to Read FFT (Very Important)

**Before reading the main manuscript, you must read:**

> **`docs/v1.2.5/appendices/README.md`**

The Appendices are **not supplementary material**.

They provide the *viewing angle* required to interpret
Sections 1–8 of the main text correctly:
χδ geometry, τ-time, projection operators, Z-reconstruction, and observation logic.

> ⚠️ Note  
> Once you start reading the Appendices, you may find yourself repeatedly
> pulled deeper into the theory.  
> This is intentional.
>
> FFT is structured so that understanding is progressively **injected**
> through cross-referenced appendices.

**The deeper you go into the Appendices,  
the more the main text reorganizes itself naturally.**

## 📐 Why FFT Does Not Conflict with Existing Physics

- **Quantum theory** observes the micro-world with a **narrow viewing angle**  
- **Cosmology** observes the macro-world through essentially the *same* narrow angle  

FFT adopts a **wide viewing angle (俯瞰)** from the start.

Therefore:

- FFT does **not** deny quantum mechanics or general relativity  
- Existing theories reappear as **restricted projections** of FFT  
- As FFT’s viewing angle is narrowed, it smoothly converges to known physics  

There is no contradiction — only difference of scope.

## Key Contributions (v1.2.5)

### 1. Minimal Equation Set (FFT-1–3)

FFT is built on a **minimal, closed equation set**:

- **FFT-1:** Fractal fixed-field equation (T-fiber dynamics)  
- **FFT-2:** Information-flow conservation equation  
- **FFT-3:** C-wave projection equation (observer-side dynamics)

These three equations form the irreducible backbone of FFT.  
All quantum, gravitational, perceptual, and cosmological phenomena
are derived as **geometric limits or projections** of this set.

---

### 2. Quantum Mechanics as Geometry

FFT reinterprets quantum mechanics as **projection geometry**, not
as intrinsic indeterminism.

Key results:

- Density operator:
  $$
  \rho = \mathcal{G}[C] = f^\dagger f
  $$

- Quantum entanglement → **Z-axis alignment**  
- Quantum teleportation → **Z-delay reassignment (arrival-time difference)**  
- Wavefunction collapse → **minimization of Z-variance**  
- Decoherence → **growth of Z-variance under environmental contact**

In the low-energy / narrow-view limit, FFT reduces to:

$$
\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

showing that Heisenberg uncertainty is a **projection artifact**, not a
fundamental axiom.

---

### 3. Cosmology Without New Particles

FFT explains cosmological phenomena **without introducing new entities**:

- **Dark matter** → residual χ-curvature (no particle required)  
- **Dark energy** → global δ-drift of the T-fiber  
- **Cosmological constant Λ** → χδ-driven relaxation term  
- **Cosmic expansion** → geometric divergence of bundled causal fibers  
  (the “wire-bundle” geometry)

General Relativity emerges as the **coarse-grained limit** of χδ curvature
dynamics.

---

### 4. Perception, Consciousness, and Free Will

FFT provides a geometric model of perception and agency:

- Observation is **2.5D**:
  - XY-plane: observable surface  
  - Z-axis: causal delay (past-depth)

- Consciousness is defined as a reconstruction process:
  $$
  \textbf{Consciousness} = \mathcal{G} \circ \Pi_{XY}
  $$

- Reflection (反省) corresponds to causal variance reduction:
  $$
  \rho_{\text{reflected}}
  =
  \arg\min_{\rho \in \mathcal{G}[C]} \mathrm{Var}_Z(\rho)
  $$

- Free will is the **ability to actively modulate χ**  
  (causal direction bandwidth), rather than randomness.

This embeds cognition and agency naturally within the same geometry
that governs physics.
