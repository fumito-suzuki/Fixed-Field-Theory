# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

> **Note on Perspective**  
> Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) does not contradict existing physical theories.  
> Quantum theory observes the microscopic world through a narrow field of view,  
> while cosmology observes the macroscopic world through a similarly constrained lens.  
> FFT adopts a **wider geometric field of view**, within which both limits are recovered.  
> As this field of view is narrowed, FFT converges smoothly with established theories.

This directory contains all **supplemental materials** for the FFT v1.2.x series.

The appendices provide:
- mathematical foundations,
- projection and reconstruction operators,
- χδ geometry and τ-time structure,
- perceptual and optical models,
- quantum and cosmological limits,
- methodological clarification (computability & falsifiability).

They are **mandatory companions** to the main manuscript.

## 1. How to Read the Appendices

You may navigate the appendices in two equivalent ways.

### A. Section-driven reading
Use the **Section–Appendix Map** (Section 4) to open the appendix supporting
the part of the main text you are reading.

### B. Domain-driven reading
Appendices are grouped by **conceptual role**, not chronology.

## 2. Appendix Domains（整理済）

### **I. Foundations & Operators**
> χδ geometry, projection, reconstruction, formal closure

- **Z+0** — χδ Principle (foundational definitions)
- **Z+1** — Ontological layers: T-wave / C-wave / ψ

  (projection operator *f*, reconstruction *G*)

---

### **II. Time, Observation & Irreversibility**
> τ-time, Z-history, collapse, decoherence, observer-free measurement

---

### **V. Methodology & Meta-Theory**
> Computability, falsifiability, model construction

- **Appendix D** — Design principles, computability, and falsifiability of FFT

(This appendix addresses reviewer concerns regarding closed equations,
computability, and empirical testability.)

---

## 3. What the Appendices Are — and Are Not

- Appendices **do not** introduce ad hoc interaction terms.
- Appendices **do not** add particle ontology.
- Appendices **do** formalize geometry, operators, and limits.
- Appendices **do** define how predictions are constructed at the model level.

FFT is **closed by construction**, not by enumeration of interaction terms.

## 6. Update Policy

- Conceptual disputes are handled in **Appendix D**.
- New appendices must be placed in a **Domain** and linked here.
- Notation must follow FFT conventions (χ, δ, ψ, τ).
