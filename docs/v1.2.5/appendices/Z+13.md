## Quantum Teleportation as Arrival-Time Reassignment  
### (ψ Generation via C-wave Arrival Delay, Not State Transfer)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum teleportation is **not** the transfer of a
physical state, particle, or wave.  
It is the reassignment of **when and where the same C-wave information becomes
observable**, determined solely by **arrival-time differences** at distinct
T-wave receptors.

The core statement is:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation = reassignment of C-wave arrival time } \tau
\textbf{ at a different T-wave receptor.}
}
\]

No object moves.  
No signal is transmitted between distant systems.  
Only the **generation point of } \psi \text{** changes.

## Z+13.1 Preliminaries: What Is (and Is Not) Observed in FFT

Recall the FFT observational hierarchy:

- **T-wave (χ)** — material substrate and receptor  
- **C-wave (δ)** — propagating interference information  
- **ψ = χδ** — generated phenomenon (observable event)

Crucially:

> **C-wave alone is never observed.**  
> Observation occurs only when a C-wave encounters a T-wave receptor,
> generating ψ.

Thus:

\[
\text{Observation}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\text{C-wave} \cap \text{T-wave}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\psi \text{ generation}.
\]

## Z+13.2 Illustrative Analogy: Three People and One Utterance

Consider the following everyday situation:

- Person **A** speaks a sentence.
- Person **B** is in the same room and hears it immediately.
- Person **C** is in a distant room and hears the same sentence later.

Key facts:

- The **content** of the sentence is identical for B and C.
- Nothing is transmitted *from B to C*.
- The only difference is the **arrival time**.

FFT mapping:

| Analogy | FFT Correspondence |
|-------|------------------|
| Spoken sentence | C-wave (information) |
| Hearing | ψ generation |
| Ear / brain | T-wave receptor |
| Delay between rooms | arrival-time difference τ |

Thus:

- B generates ψ earlier: `ψ_B`  
- C generates ψ later: `ψ_C`  
- No “state transfer” occurs between B and C.

## Z+13.3 Entanglement as C-wave Branching (Precondition)

Quantum entanglement prepares the situation in which:

- a single C-wave structure
- is available to multiple potential T-wave receptors
- with no ψ generated yet

In FFT terms:

- **Entanglement = C-wave branching**
- No particles exist
- No observation has occurred
- ψ has not yet been generated

This corresponds exactly to the spoken sentence **before anyone hears it**.

---

## Z+13.4 Teleportation = Switching the First ψ-Generation Site

Teleportation occurs when experimental conditions ensure that:

- the C-wave reaches receptor **B** first in one configuration, or  
- the same C-wave reaches receptor **C** first in another configuration

Mathematically:

\[
\tau_B < \tau_C
\quad \text{or} \quad
\tau_C < \tau_B.
\]

Whichever receptor is reached first generates ψ:

\[
\psi(x,y) = \chi_{\text{receptor}} \, \delta_{\text{arriving}}.
\]

The “teleported state” is simply:

> **the same C-wave information becoming observable at a different location
> due to arrival-time reassignment.**

---

## Z+13.5 Why No Physical Transfer Is Required

Because:

- C-wave propagation is continuous and local  
- T-wave receptors are passive  
- ψ is generated *only at reception*

there is:

- no particle transfer  
- no wave packet transport between observers  
- no superluminal signal  

The illusion of nonlocality arises because:

> **observers mistake arrival-time reassignment for state transfer.**

---

## Z+13.6 Relation to ψ as “Particle”

In FFT:

- **Particles are not fundamental entities.**
- A particle is the **event of ψ generation**.

Thus:

- ψ generated at B → “particle at B”  
- ψ generated at C → “particle at C”  

Teleportation therefore does **not** move a particle.  
It changes **where ψ appears first**.

---

## Z+13.7 Consistency with Measurement and Decoherence

Measurement introduces environmental χ, modifying arrival conditions:

\[
\chi \to \chi + \delta\chi.
\]

This alters effective τ ordering and destroys the delicate arrival-time
structure required for teleportation.

Thus:

- teleportation is fragile  
- decoherence is arrival-time scrambling  
- collapse is ψ generation fixing history along Zχ

## Z+13.8 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation in FFT is not transmission.}
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{It is the reassignment of when the same C-wave generates ψ.}
}
\]

- Entanglement = C-wave branching  
- Teleportation = arrival-time reassignment  
- Particle = ψ (generated phenomenon)  
- Nonlocality = misinterpretation of timing  
- No observer privilege required  

Quantum teleportation is therefore a **purely geometric and temporal effect**,
fully consistent with the χδ–ψ framework of Fixed-Field Theory.
