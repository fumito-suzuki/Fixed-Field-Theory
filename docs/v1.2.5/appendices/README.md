# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

> **Note on Perspective**  
> Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) does not contradict existing physical theories.  
> Quantum theory observes the microscopic world through a narrow field of view,  
> while cosmology observes the macroscopic world through a similarly constrained lens.  
> FFT adopts a **wider field of view**, within which both limits are naturally recovered.  
> As this field of view is narrowed, FFT converges smoothly with established theories.
>
> **Ontological Note**  
> In Fixed-Field Theory, **ψ is neither a physical field nor a directly observable quantity**.  
> ψ is a *generated phenomenological geometry* produced by χδ coupling at reception.  
>  
> χ and δ are not symmetric observables:
> - χ governs causal accumulation (inferred, not directly observed),
> - δ governs interference and observation (measurable).

This directory contains all supplementary materials for the FFT v1.2.x series.  
The appendices provide mathematical proofs, projection operators, χδ geometry,
τ-time analysis, perceptual models, cosmological extensions, and experimental
considerations that support the main manuscript.

This README explains **how to navigate the Appendix set** and  
**how each appendix relates to Sections 1–7 of FFT v1.2.5.1**.

# 1. Purpose of the Appendices

The main manuscript introduces:

- χδ geometry（χ = causal depth, δ = interference density）  
- ψ = χδ（appearance field; not a physical wave）  
- T-fiber / T-wave（physical structure）  
- C-wave（XτZ / YτZ projection）  
- τ（phase-time）  
- FFT-1 / FFT-2 / FFT-3（field, information, projection dynamics）  
- Sora Equation（ψ dynamics on the C-wave）  
- G-operator（Z-extension → χ-band reconstruction）  
- consciousness as the selection of χ  

Many of these require **extended derivations** or **geometric formalization**,  
which are provided in the appendices.

Appendices serve as:

- mathematical proofs  
- operator-level definitions（f-projection, G-extension）  
- perceptual / optical geometry  
- χδ-oscillation and ψ-dynamics  
- cosmological curvature models  
- experimental proposals  
- cross-scale curvature interpretation  

They are **mandatory companions** to the main theory.

> **Interpretational Rule**  
> - ψ must never be interpreted as a propagating wave or conserved substance.  
> - Collapse, decoherence, and observation are χδ-geometric processes,  
>   not observer-dependent postulates.

# 2. How to Use the Appendices

You may navigate the appendices in two ways:

## A. Section-driven reading  
Use the **Section–Appendix Map** (below) to open the appendix that supports the
specific section you are reading in the main text.

## B. Domain-driven reading  
Appendices naturally cluster into four conceptual domains.

# 6. Contribution Notes（更新ポリシー）

- Appendices must remain **self-contained** and consistent with Sections 1–7.  
- Updating Sections 1–7 requires updating this README.  
- Notation must follow FFT conventions：χ, δ, ψ, τ, C-wave, T-fiber.  
- ψ is an **appearance field**, not a wave or conserved quantity.  
- χ is **not directly observable**; it is inferred from geometric consistency.  
- δ-derived quantities are the only directly measurable observables.  
- GR and QM are treated as **scale limits of FFT**, not independent axioms.
