## Decoherence as χ-Depth Divergence  
### (Irreversible Loss of C-Wave Coherence via Zχ Expansion)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), **decoherence is not a quantum mystery** and not a
special postulate.  
It is a **geometric inevitability** arising from divergence in causal depth χ.

The central statement is:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence = divergence of causal depth } Z_\chi
}
\]

Once χ-depth diverges, coherent C-wave branching can no longer be maintained,
and ψ-generation becomes irreversible.

## Z+16.1 Decoherence Is Not Observation

FFT makes a strict distinction:

- **Observation**  
  = generation of ψ when C-wave meets a T-wave receptor  

- **Decoherence**  
  = loss of χ-coherence *before* ψ-generation  

Thus:

> **Decoherence can occur without observation.**

A system may decohere entirely in the dark, in isolation from any observer,
simply by interacting with an uncontrolled environment.

## Z+16.2 Definition of χ-Depth (Zχ)

Causal depth is defined as accumulated χ-history:

\[
Z_\chi
=
\int \omega_0' \, dt
+
\int \mathcal{F}_\chi(\chi,\delta)\, dt.
\]

Properties of \( Z_\chi \):

- irreversible  
- monotonic  
- not directly observable  
- shared only under strict coherence conditions  

This depth encodes **causal alignment**, not perceptual depth.

## Z+16.3 How Environmental Interaction Causes Zχ Divergence

Consider a system S interacting weakly with an environment E.

Environmental contact introduces stochastic χ-perturbations:

\[
\chi_S \rightarrow \chi_S + \delta\chi_E.
\]

Because χ enters the Sora dynamics nonlinearly:

\[
\partial_t \psi
=
\omega_0'
+ D\Delta\psi
+ \kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2
+ \xi,
\]

even small perturbations lead to cumulative divergence:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_\chi > 0.
\]

This process is unavoidable.

---

## Z+16.4 Loss of C-Wave Coherence

C-wave interference requires **χ-alignment**.

As soon as:

\[
\Delta Z_\chi
=
|Z_{\chi,1} - Z_{\chi,2}|
>
Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
\]

where \( Z_{\mathrm{coh}} \) is the coherence tolerance,

then:

- relative C-wave phase becomes undefined  
- interference averages to zero  
- branching coherence collapses  

Formally:

\[
\langle C_1 C_2^* \rangle \to 0.
\]

This is decoherence.

---

## Z+16.5 Relation to Entanglement (Z+15)

From Z+15:

- entanglement = coherent C-wave branching under shared \( Z_\chi \)  
- ψ = 0 throughout entangled phase  

Decoherence is simply the **destruction of this condition**:

\[
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}
\;\;\longrightarrow\;\;
Z_{\chi,A} \neq Z_{\chi,B}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence = entanglement decay = } \Delta Z_\chi > 0
}
\]

No additional mechanism is required.

---

## Z+16.6 Why Decoherence Is Irreversible

Because χ accumulates irreversibly:

- χ-history cannot be “unwritten”  
- Zχ cannot decrease  
- re-alignment is statistically impossible  

Therefore:

> **Recoherence is not forbidden, but astronomically improbable.**

This explains why macroscopic superpositions are never observed.

---

## Z+16.7 Why Decoherence Precedes Collapse

In FFT:

1. C-wave branching exists (potential only)  
2. χ-depth diverges (decoherence)  
3. one branch later generates ψ  
4. ψ writes irreversible history  

Thus:

- collapse is not the cause of decoherence  
- decoherence is the **precondition** for collapse  

This ordering resolves confusion in standard interpretations.

---

## Z+16.8 Relation to Observation and Measurement

Measurement introduces a **dense χ-environment**:

- detectors  
- surrounding matter  
- thermal noise  

This accelerates Zχ divergence:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_\chi \gg 0.
\]

Thus measurement causes **rapid decoherence**, but does not define it.

Observation merely records the outcome.

---

## Z+16.9 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence = divergence of causal depth } Z_\chi
}
\]

- independent of observers  
- independent of ψ-generation  
- independent of consciousness  

It is a geometric consequence of χ-dynamics.

Together with:

- Z+13 (Teleportation = arrival-time ordering)  
- Z+15 (Entanglement = C-wave branching)  

this completes FFT’s **non-anthropocentric, fully geometric measurement theory**.
