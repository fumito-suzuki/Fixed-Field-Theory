## Quantum Entanglement as Z-Axis Divergence  
### (Hybrid Z-axis = Retarded Time + Causal-Density Separation)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum entanglement is reinterpreted as  
**a divergence of Z-axis causal structure between two points in the XY-plane.**

While standard quantum mechanics treats entanglement as nonlocal correlation
between Hilbert-space vectors, FFT grounds the phenomenon in **geometry**:

\[
\boxed{
\Delta Z
= c\,\Delta t_{\mathrm{ret}}
+ \lambda \int \Delta\rho_T\, ds
}
\]

where

- \( c\Delta t_{\mathrm{ret}} \): retarded-time separation (photon arrival-time difference)  
- \( \lambda\int \Delta\rho_T ds \): difference in causal-density accumulation (T-fiber depth)  

Entanglement corresponds to **alignment** of Z-axes:

\[
\Delta Z = 0.
\]

Decoherence corresponds to **divergence** of Z-axes:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
\]

This appendix provides the geometric, dynamical, and observational meaning of this formulation.

## Z+15.1 Definition: Z-axis Separation

FFT defines the Z-axis of a point \((x,y,t)\) as:

\[
Z(x,y,t)
=
c\,\Delta t_{\mathrm{ret}}(x,y,t)
\;+\;
\lambda
\int_{\gamma}
\rho_T(x,y,z,t)\, ds.
\]

Two events A and B are **entangled** when:

\[
Z_A = Z_B.
\]

This means:

- the retarded-time depth (light travel correction), and  
- the accumulated causal density (T-fiber depth)  

are identical.

They “share” a Z-axis.

---

## Z+15.2 Entanglement = Shared Z-axis

FFT replaces the QM postulate:

> “Entangled particles occupy a joint Hilbert-space state.”

with a geometric condition:

\[
\boxed{
\Delta Z = 0
}
\]

which implies:

- equal causal depth  
- equal interference phase  
- shared χδ loop  
- shared ψ curvature gradient  

Thus, FFT provides a **physical field model** for the apparently nonlocal
structure of entanglement.

This is identical in mathematical effect to the QM density-operator
non-factorizability:

\[
\rho_{AB} \neq \rho_A \otimes \rho_B.
\]

but with **geometric meaning attached**.

## Z+15.3 Why Measurement Breaks Entanglement  
### (Derivation of d/dt ΔZ > 0)

Measurement introduces an asymmetric χ-injection.  
Let the measurement act on subsystem A:

\[
\chi_A \to \chi_A + \delta\chi.
\]

Since ψ = χδ, this perturbs the ψ-field:

\[
\psi_A \to \psi_A + \delta\psi,
\]

which perturbs its causal density:

\[
 \rho_{T,A} \to \rho_{T,A} + \delta\rho_T.
\]

Therefore the Z-axis transforms as:

\[
Z_A \to Z_A + c\,\delta(\Delta t_{\mathrm{ret}}) 
+ \lambda \int \delta\rho_T\,ds.
\]

But the detector’s interaction always **increases** local curvature
(mainly via boundary condition breaking), so:

\[
\delta\rho_T > 0.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}
\Delta Z
=
\frac{d}{dt}(Z_A - Z_B)
> 0.
\]

This is the **FFT derivation of decoherence**.

## Z+15.4 Why Entanglement Appears Instantaneous

Even when A and B are light-years apart,

- the equality \(Z_A = Z_B\) does not depend on the XY separation  
- because Z is a **depth coordinate**, not a spatial coordinate

Thus:

- entanglement is not transmission through space  
- it is **alignment across causal depth**

Instantaneity arises because Z is orthogonal to spacetime.

This resolves the EPR paradox geometrically.

---

## Z+15.5 Entanglement Swapping and Teleportation

Teleportation in QM corresponds to:

\[
Z_A = Z_C,\quad Z_B = Z_C
\quad\Rightarrow\quad Z_A = Z_B.
\]

In FFT this is:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB} = 0
\quad\text{mediated by}\quad C.
\]

Swap operations simply **realign the Z-axes** of subsystems.

There is no need for Hilbert-space “collapse postulates” in FFT.

---

## Z+15.6 Decoherence as Divergence of Z

Environmental noise injects δχ curvature into the system, giving:

\[
\delta\rho_T > 0,
\]

thus:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
\]

This produces:

- phase scrambling  
- interference loss  
- collapse  
- classicalization  

in perfect correspondence with standard decoherence theory,  
but with **geometric meaning** rather than operator-algebra meaning.

---

## Z+15.7 Summary

Entanglement occurs when:

\[
Z_A = Z_B.
\]

Decoherence occurs when:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
\]

Z is a hybrid depth coordinate:

\[
Z
=
c\Delta t_{\mathrm{ret}}
+ \lambda \int \rho_T ds,
\]

which unifies:

- delayed-time optics  
- causal curvature  
- interference phase alignment  
- ψ dynamics  
- χδ recursion  
- density-operator correlations  

Thus FFT provides a **geometric realization of quantum entanglement**  
that preserves all quantitative quantum predictions  
while offering an intuitive physical interpretation.
