# Appendix B — The Fractal Laplacian Δᴰ in Fixed-Field Geometry  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5.1 Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides the mathematical foundation of the **fractal Laplacian
$\Delta^{D}$** in Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

Its purpose is to:

- define $\Delta^{D}$ rigorously within FFT,
- derive its origin from χδ scaling,
- clarify its role in ψ-dynamics and T-fiber geometry,
- connect multi-scale curvature formation to cosmological behavior.

This appendix establishes $\Delta^{D}$ as the operator encoding
**fractal causal structure** in FFT.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT is founded on the χδ principle:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The scaling exponents of χ and δ define:

- χ — causal depth scaling exponent $a$,
- δ — interference density scaling exponent $b$.

Their coupling yields the effective fractal order:

$$
D = a + b.
$$

This identifies $\Delta^{D}$ as the natural operator governing non-local
geometry arising from χδ coupling.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Mathematical Definition (Riesz Form)

For $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the fractal Laplacian is defined in Fourier space as

$$
\mathcal{F}\!\left[\Delta^{D} f\right](\mathbf{k}) =
-|\mathbf{k}|^{D}\,\hat f(\mathbf{k}),
\qquad
D > 0.
$$

This definition ensures:

- linearity,
- self-adjointness,
- negative definiteness,
- intrinsic non-locality,
- reduction to the standard Laplacian when $D = 2$.

### 3.2 Real-Space Representation

Equivalently, $\Delta^{D}$ admits the Riesz kernel form

$$
(\Delta^{D} f)(x) =
C_{n,D}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{|x-y|^{n+D}}\,dy.
$$

This representation highlights:

- long-range curvature coupling,
- multi-scale sensitivity,
- filamentary structure formation near curvature concentrations.

### 3.3 Result

Acting on the appearance field $\psi$, the operator $\Delta^{D}$ induces:

- curvature sharpening across scales,
- amplification of ψ-gradients,
- exchange between interference and causal depth structure.

This provides the operator-level mechanism for fractal geometry in FFT.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The operator $\Delta^{D}$ analytically encodes χδ coupling:

- χ contributes depth curvature along Z,
- δ contributes transverse interference structure,
- their product yields fractal order $D$.

Thus non-local causality and multi-scale patterning arise directly from
$\Delta^{D}\psi$.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines the interpretation of the main text:

- **Section 2 (FFT-1):**  
  the hybrid operator
  $$
  \Delta + \ell_D^{\,2-D}\Delta^{D}
  $$
  explains the coexistence of smoothing and fractal sharpening.

- **Section 3 (Irreversibility):**  
  $\Delta^{D}$ induces Z-direction superdiffusion and irreversible depth growth.

- **Section 4 (Perception):**  
  enhanced ψ-gradients correspond to sharper C-wave contours and perceptual edges.

- **Section 5 (Quantum Limit):**  
  in low-curvature regimes, $\Delta^{D}$ becomes negligible and FFT reduces to
  standard quantum behavior.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

The fractal Laplacian contributes to:

- **8.5** — derivation of $\Lambda$ from χδ scaling,
- **8.6** — dark-curvature mass–energy balance,
- **8.8** — ψ-instability and turbulence,
- **8.9** — τ-spreading and Z-depth measures.

These concern calibration and phenomenology, not theory closure.

## 7. Summary

The fractal Laplacian $\Delta^{D}$ in FFT is:

- a non-local differential operator,
- determined by χδ scaling,
- responsible for multi-scale curvature formation,
- essential for decoherence and irreversibility,
- negligible in the quantum limit,
- central to cosmological scaling behavior.

$\Delta^{D}$ is therefore a fundamental mathematical component of
Fixed-Field Theory, encoding fractal causality within the χδ framework.
