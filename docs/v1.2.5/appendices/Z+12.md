# Appendix Z+12  
## Physical Observables of the C-wave in FFT  
### (T-wave / C-wave / ψ-wave and What Each Can Reveal)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), all “waves” relevant to observation are organized
into three distinct but interacting layers:

- **T-wave (T-fiber)**: matter itself and its vibrations (receptors included)  
- **C-wave**: electromagnetic interference waves (light, infrared, radio, …)  
- **ψ-wave**: the χδ-generated geometry at material boundaries (surfaces, interfaces)

This appendix clarifies **what can be physically observed from the C-wave**, and
how this differs from observation of T-waves and ψ-waves.

## Z+12.1 Three Layers of Reality in FFT

FFT distinguishes:

1. **T-wave (T-fiber, matter layer)**  
   - high-density regions of the fixed field  
   - atoms, molecules, solids, liquids, gases  
   - receptors themselves (retina, cochlea, olfactory epithelium, skin, etc.)  
   - macroscopic vibrations:  
     - **sound** (pressure waves in matter)  
     - **mechanical vibration**  
     - **thermal motion**  
   - **T-wave is “there” even without observation**. It *is* matter.

2. **C-wave (electromagnetic information layer)**  
   - light (visible, UV)  
   - infrared  
   - radio waves, microwaves  
   - X-rays, γ-rays  
   - cannot exist “as experienced reality” without being picked up by T-wave receptors  
   - C-wave is the **information-carrying interference** that must be read by matter.

3. **ψ-wave (χδ generator layer)**  
   - ψ = χδ  
   - defines geometry at material surfaces  
   - shapes:  
     - edges, shadows  
     - gloss, texture  
     - apparent depth  
   - not directly observed as a “wave”, but as **how material surfaces appear** when C-wave interacts with T-wave.

Observation in FFT is always some combination of:

$$
\text{C-wave (information)} \;\to\; \text{T-wave (receptor / matter)} \;\to\; \text{ψ-wave geometry (appearance)}.
$$

## Z+12.2 What is a C-wave in Operational Terms?

In FFT, a **C-wave** is defined as:

> “Any interference wave that requires a T-wave receptor to become part of
> experienced reality.”

Concretely:

- light photons hitting the retina  
- infrared detected by a sensor  
- radio waves sensed by an antenna  
- X-rays recorded on a detector  

Without T-wave (matter) as receptor, C-waves remain **unrealized potentials**:
they exist as interference in the fixed field, but not as “observed signals.”

---

## Z+12.3 Observable Quantities of the C-wave

The C-wave has a restricted set of **physically observable** quantities:

### (1) Intensity (Amplitude Squared)

$$
I(x,y,t) = |C(x,y,t)|^2.
$$

Interpreted as:

- brightness (visible light)  
- IR flux  
- radio signal strength  
- X-ray dose  

All standard detectors measure **|C|²**, not C itself.

---

### (2) Frequency / Spectrum

$$
\omega_C, \quad S(\omega_C) = |\hat{C}(\omega_C)|^2.
$$

This includes:

- color (photon energy / frequency)  
- radio carrier frequencies  
- microwave bands  
- spectral lines in X-ray or γ-ray astronomy  

The spectral structure of C-wave is what spectrometers measure.

---

### (3) Spatial Gradients and Curvature

$$
\nabla C, \quad \Delta C.
$$

These encode:

- edges, contours, boundaries  
- focusing, defocusing, caustics  
- interference fringes in optics  

In vision, neural systems effectively compute ∇C and ΔC; in imaging, edge
filters do the same.

---

### (4) Relative Phase / Coherence

$$
\phi_{12}(x,y,t) = \arg\big(C_1^*(x,y,t) C_2(x,y,t)\big).
$$

Phase differences are observable via:

- optical interference (double-slit, interferometers)  
- radio interferometry (VLBI)  
- holography  

Phase itself is not measured directly; **interference patterns** are the
observable consequences of phase relations between C-waves.

## Z+12.4 How T-wave and ψ-wave Are Observed (by Contrast)

To situate C-wave observables, FFT clarifies what is (and is not) observed from
T-wave and ψ-wave.

---

### (1) T-wave observables (matter layer)

T-wave corresponds to **matter and its internal dynamics**.

Typical observables:

- position, mass, momentum of macroscopic objects  
- vibrational frequencies of solids (phonons, sound)  
- chemical identity (via reactions, smell, binding)  
- temperature (statistical T-wave vibrations)

T-wave can exist and evolve **without any C-wave**: a block of matter sitting
in the dark still has internal T-wave dynamics.

Sound and smell in FFT:

- **sound** = pressure T-wave in matter  
- **smell** = T-wave in the form of molecular shape and binding  

They are *not* C-waves; they are **matter-level excitations**.

---

### (2) ψ-wave observables (appearance geometry)

ψ = χδ defines how C-wave is curved by χ and how that curvature is expressed at
T-wave boundaries (surfaces).

Observable consequences of ψ:

- shape and contour of objects  
- shadows and shading  
- texture, gloss, translucency  
- apparent depth, occlusion, figure–ground separation  

We do not observe ψ as a “wave”; rather, we observe **material surfaces whose
appearance is governed by ψ** when C-wave hits T-wave.

In short:

- T-wave: “something is there.”  
- C-wave: “waves come from/into that something.”  
- ψ-wave: “this is *how* that something looks.”

---

## Z+12.5 Why Observation is Necessary for C-waves

T-wave (matter) does not need observation to exist.  
ψ-wave (geometry) shapes the possible appearances regardless of observation.  

However:

- C-waves only become **events** (measurements) when absorbed or scattered by
  T-wave receptors.  
- Without T-wave interaction, C-wave remains a **pure χδ interference pattern**
  in the fixed field.

Thus:

> **Observation is necessary not for matter to exist,  
> but for C-wave information to become part of the material history.**

This resolves the apparent “observer paradox”:

- the world exists (T-wave) independently of observation,  
- but EM information (C-wave) must be received by matter to become a recorded
  fact.

## Z+12.6 Experimental Mapping of C-wave Observables

FFT predicts that all C-wave observables correspond to standard measurement
devices:

| FFT quantity       | Example detectors                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| $|C|^2$ intensity | CCD/CMOS sensors, photomultipliers     |
| spectrum $S(\omega_C)$ | spectrometers, radio receivers        |
| ∇C, ΔC             | edge filters, gradient-based vision models |
| phase / coherence  | interferometers, holographic setups    |

This alignment ensures that FFT is not merely philosophical:  
it makes **experimentally accessible predictions** about the role and limits of
C-wave information.

## Z+12.7 Summary

In FFT:

- **T-wave (T-fiber)** = matter itself and its vibrations (sound, smell, etc.).  
- **C-wave** = electromagnetic interference (light, IR, radio, …) that requires
  T-wave receptors to be realized as observations.  
- **ψ-wave** = χδ geometry at material surfaces, shaping *how* things appear.

The **physically observable quantities of the C-wave** are:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Observables of C-wave}
=
\left\{
|C|^2,\;
\omega_C,\;
\nabla C,\;
\text{interference-derived phase}
\right\}.
}
$$

These sit between:

- T-wave observables (matter, vibration, chemistry), and  
- ψ-wave observables (appearance, structure, depth),

forming the **information layer of the universe** in Fixed-Field Theory.
