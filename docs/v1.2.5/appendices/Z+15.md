*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5 Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope  

This appendix provides a geometric reinterpretation of **quantum entanglement**
within Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), consistent with the main text.

In FFT, entanglement is **not** the sharing of physical substance nor the
identification of causal histories.  
It is a condition defined strictly at the level of **observable generation**.

The precise condition is:

$$
\boxed{
\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs},AB} = 0.
}
$$

where $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$ denotes the **observational depth** associated with
2.5D ψ-generation on delayed planes $(X\tau Z,\,Y\tau Z)$.

The goals of this appendix are to:

- define entanglement as **alignment of observational Z-depth**,  
- distinguish observational depth from χτ causal depth,  
- explain nonlocal correlation without signal transmission,  
- unify entanglement loss and decoherence geometrically.  

---

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework and Z-Depth Separation)  

FFT distinguishes two conceptually different notions of “depth”:

### (1) Observational depth  
$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \equiv \tau\text{-delay depth}
$$

- arises from C-wave propagation delay,  
- defines the surface on which ψ is generated,  
- corresponds to 2.5D perceptual geometry $(X\tau Z,\,Y\tau Z)$,  
- is **not** a causal history.

### (2) Causal depth  
$$
Z_{\chi} \equiv \text{accumulated χτ depth}
$$

- belongs to the T-fiber (Ψ),  
- encodes irreversible causal history,  
- governs irreversibility and time asymmetry,  
- is **not directly observable**.

This appendix concerns **only** $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$.

---

## 3. Main Geometric Model  

### 3.1 Z_obs as Interference Focus Parameter  

ψ is generated only when χδ interference occurs at a stable observational depth.

This stability requires:

$$
\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \approx 0.
$$

Thus, $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$ functions as a **focus parameter** for ψ-generation,
not as a physical coordinate.

---

### 3.2 Definition: Entanglement as Shared Z_obs  

Let systems A and B generate observable fields $\psi_A$ and $\psi_B$.

Define their observational depths as:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A}, \qquad Z_{\mathrm{obs},B}.
$$

Then entanglement is defined by:

$$
\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs},AB} = |Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} - Z_{\mathrm{obs},B}| = 0.
$$

Under this condition:

- ψ_A and ψ_B are generated on the same delayed-plane layer,  
- χτ causal histories remain independent,  
- no physical transfer or identification of substance occurs.

Entanglement is therefore **co-generation of ψ**, not sharing of χ.

---

### 3.3 Why Entanglement Appears Instantaneous  

Spatial separation in the XY-plane does not affect $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$.

Thus, even for arbitrarily large XY separation:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} = Z_{\mathrm{obs},B}
$$

implies synchronized ψ-generation.

No signal propagates.  
No causal influence is exchanged.

The apparent nonlocality arises because a **Z_obs-global geometry**
is projected onto **XY-local observation**.

---

## 4. Measurement and Loss of Entanglement  

### 4.1 Measurement as Z_obs Divergence  

Measurement couples system A to an environment E, perturbing its χ structure.
This modifies the ψ-generation condition:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} \to Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} + \delta Z_{\mathrm{obs},A}.
$$

Thus:

$$
\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs},AB} > 0.
$$

Once the mismatch exceeds the coherence tolerance:

$$
\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs},AB} > Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
$$

joint ψ-generation becomes impossible.

This is **entanglement collapse**.

---

### 4.2 Decoherence and Entanglement Loss  

Environmental interaction generically produces:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs}} > 0.
$$

Therefore:

> **Decoherence and entanglement decay are the same phenomenon:  
> divergence of observational depth.**

No reference to χτ-history matching is required.

---

## 5. Bell Inequality and Entanglement Swapping  

Bell-type correlations arise because, prior to measurement:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} = Z_{\mathrm{obs},B} = Z_{\mathrm{obs},C} = \dots
$$

for all participating systems.

This defines a shared **observational depth layer** invisible to XY-local
observers.

Entanglement swapping corresponds to reassignment of $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$
membership, not to physical transmission.

Thus:

> Nonlocal correlation = projection of shared Z_obs geometry onto XY slices.

## 6. Implications for Main Sections  

This appendix clarifies:

- **Section 5 (Quantum limit):**  
  entanglement arises from ψ-coherence, not state nonlocality.  

- **Section 6 (Cosmology):**  
  large-scale coherence reflects extended Z_obs domains.  

- **Section 7 (Consciousness):**  
  perceptual stability depends on sustained Z_obs alignment.

## 7. Summary  

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} = \textbf{alignment of observational depth }(Z_{\mathrm{obs}})
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Collapse} = \textbf{divergence of } Z_{\mathrm{obs}}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = \frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_{\mathrm{obs}} > 0
}
$$

In Fixed-Field Theory, quantum entanglement is not a mystery of action at a
distance, but a geometric fact:

**ψ is generated on the same observational depth layer,  
even when systems are far apart in XY.**
