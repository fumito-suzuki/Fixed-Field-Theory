# Appendix Z+21 — Deriving General Relativity from T-Fiber Geometry  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix shows how **Einstein gravity emerges naturally** from the curvature
structure of the T-fiber field $\Psi$ within Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

General Relativity (GR) is recovered as the **macroscopic, low-frequency,
coarse-grained limit** of the χδ-coupled generator field $\psi$.

The central claim is that the Einstein field equations

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \, T_{\mu\nu}
$$

are not fundamental postulates, but the **projection of a deeper geometric
identity** governing T-fiber dynamics.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT defines the generator field as

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The field $\psi$ encodes the joint action of:

- χ — causal curvature injection,
- δ — interference density.

Spacetime geometry, matter, and gravity are not introduced independently.
They arise from **collective curvature behavior** of $\psi$ embedded in the
T-fiber field $\Psi$.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 T-Fiber Curvature from ψ

Gradients of $\psi$ determine local information density in the T-fiber:

$$
\rho_T =
\beta_1 \|\nabla\psi\|^2 +
\beta_2 \|\nabla C\|^2 -
\gamma \rho_T
$$

Define the effective **T-fiber curvature tensor**

$$
\mathcal{K}_{ij} =
\partial_i \partial_j \psi.
$$

This tensor measures how χ-curvature and δ-interference jointly warp local
information geometry.

### 3.2 Induced Metric from the T-Fiber Field

FFT does not assume a spacetime metric a priori.

An effective metric is induced from $\Psi$ as

$$
g_{ij} =
\frac{\partial_i \Psi \, \partial_j \Psi}{\|\nabla\Psi\|^2}.
$$

This construction yields:

- null directions where $\Psi$ is stationary,
- a timelike axis aligned with steepest $\partial\Psi$ curvature,
- spatial distance as angular separation in $\nabla\Psi$ space.

Redshift, null cones, and gravitational time dilation emerge directly from
$\psi$ dynamics.

### 3.3 Coarse-Grained Ricci Curvature

Define a coarse-grained Ricci tensor by averaging over a scale
$\ell$ much larger than the χδ microstructure:

$$
R_{ij} =
\langle
\mathcal{K}_{ij} -
\frac{1}{2} g_{ij}\mathcal{K}^k_{\,k}
\rangle_{\ell}.
$$

Here:

- $\mathcal{K}_{ij} = \partial_i\partial_j\psi$,
- $\mathcal{K}^k_{\,k}$ is the trace of ψ-curvature.

High-frequency curvature is smoothed out, leaving macroscopic curvature
consistent with Ricci flow.

### 3.4 Stress-Energy from χδ Coupling

Matter is not a separate field in FFT.
It corresponds to **persistent localized curvature** of $\psi$.

Define the stress-energy tensor as

$$
T_{ij} =
\langle
\nabla_i\psi \, \nabla_j\psi -
\frac{1}{2} g_{ij}\|\nabla\psi\|^2
\rangle_{\ell}.
$$

This tensor automatically satisfies:

- positive energy conditions,
- conservation
  $$
  \nabla^i T_{ij} = 0,
  $$
- vanishing trace for radiation,
- nonzero trace for massive matter.

Classical matter is therefore a stable χδ configuration in the T-fiber.

### 3.5 Einstein Tensor from Smoothed ψ Dynamics

The Einstein tensor is defined by

$$
G_{ij} =
R_{ij} -
\frac{1}{2} g_{ij} R.
$$

FFT identifies this with the coarse-grained second-derivative structure of $\psi$:

$$
G_{ij} =
\lambda_1 \langle \partial_i\partial_j \psi \rangle_{\ell} +
\lambda_2 g_{ij} \langle \Delta \psi \rangle_{\ell}.
$$

The constants $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are fixed by T-fiber scaling.

Using the FFT operator constraint

$$
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}} \Psi = 0
$$

together with

$$
\Psi = e^{\int \psi \, dt},
$$

Einstein-type curvature constraints emerge on the smoothed $\psi$ field.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Combining:

- Ricci curvature from second derivatives of $\psi$,
- stress-energy from gradient magnitudes of $\psi$,
- FFT smoothing identities,

one obtains

$$
G_{ij} =
8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}} \, T_{ij},
$$

with

$$
G_{\mathrm{eff}} =
\frac{\lambda_1}{\beta_1} =
\frac{\lambda_2}{\beta_2}.
$$

The gravitational constant is thus a **derived quantity**, fixed by χδ coupling.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix implies that:

- gravity is not a separate interaction,
- spacetime geometry is emergent,
- matter corresponds to stabilized ψ-curvature,
- GR is the long-wavelength limit of FFT.

Einstein gravity appears when χδ microstructure is averaged out.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.3** — emergence of spacetime geometry,
- **8.6** — unification of gravity with quantum structure,
- **8.8** — singularity resolution in χδ dynamics,
- **8.12** — scale-dependence of gravitational coupling.

## 7. Summary

We have shown that:

- ψ curvature defines local geometry
  $$
  \mathcal{K}_{ij} = \partial_i\partial_j\psi,
  $$
- coarse-graining yields Ricci curvature
  $$
  R_{ij} =
  \left\langle
  \mathcal{K}_{ij} -
  \tfrac{1}{2} g_{ij}\mathcal{K}^k_{\,k}
  \right\rangle_{\ell},
  $$
- stress-energy emerges from ψ-gradients
  $$
  T_{ij} =
  \left\langle
  \nabla_i\psi\nabla_j\psi -
  \tfrac{1}{2} g_{ij}\|\nabla\psi\|^2
  \right\rangle_{\ell},
  $$
- Einstein equations follow naturally
  $$
  G_{ij} = 8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}}\, T_{ij}.
  $$

Einstein gravity is therefore **not fundamental**.

It is the averaged macroscopic behavior of **χδ-curvature in the T-fiber field**.
