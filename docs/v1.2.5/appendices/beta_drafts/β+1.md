# Appendix β+1 — Numerical Consistency of the Cosmological Constant Λ  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5.1 Supplemental Material — Draft / Non-Canonical)*

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope  

This appendix examines whether the Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) prediction for the
cosmological constant Λ,

`Λ_FFT = α ⟨‖∇(χδ)‖²⟩_cosmic`,

can naturally reproduce the observed value

`Λ_obs ≈ 10⁻⁵² m⁻²`

**without fine-tuning**.

It supports **Section 6** and **Section 8.4.5** of the main text by addressing
the following restricted goals:

- evaluate the *order-of-magnitude consistency* of Λ derived from χδ geometry,  
- identify which geometric contributions dominate Λ at late cosmic times,  
- clarify why Λ is expected to be positive, extremely small, and stable.

This appendix does **not** introduce a new cosmological model and does **not**
assert canonical status for the numerical estimate presented here.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)  

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- χ — causal-depth curvature along the Z-direction,  
- δ — interference density on delayed projection planes,  
- ψ = χδ — appearance-generating information-gradient field,  
- Λ — large-scale geometric effect arising from ψ-divergence.

The main text states:

> *Dark energy corresponds to large-scale χδ drift and relaxation of the
> T-fiber bundle, not to a vacuum energy density.*  
> (Section 6)

Appendix Z+5 further establishes Λ as a **purely geometric quantity**
derived from ψ-divergence.

This appendix focuses solely on the **numerical plausibility** of that claim.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model  

### 3.1 Setup  

Define the fields:

- Ψ(x, y, z, t) — real T-fiber / T-wave field,  
- ψ(x, y, t) — observable appearance field,  
- χ(x, y, z, t) — causal curvature,  
- δ(x, y, t) — smoothed interference density.

The FFT prediction for Λ is expressed as:

`Λ_FFT = α ⟨‖∇(χδ)‖²⟩_cosmic`,

where the average is taken over cosmological scales.

---

### 3.2 Key Equations  

Decomposing the gradient:

`∇(χδ) = δ∇χ + χ∇δ`.

On scales larger than approximately 100 Mpc, the universe is statistically
homogeneous. We therefore assume:

1. χ varies only on very large curvature scales,  
2. δ is strongly smoothed by cosmic expansion,  
3. cross terms are suppressed by large-scale averaging.

Under these assumptions:

`Λ_FFT ≈ α ( δ₀² ⟨‖∇χ‖²⟩ + χ₀² ⟨‖∇δ‖²⟩ )`.

FFT identifies the first term as dominant in the late universe, yielding:

`Λ_FFT ≈ α δ₀² ⟨‖∇χ‖²⟩`.

---

### 3.3 Result  

The observed cosmological constant corresponds to a curvature scale:

`R_Λ = Λ_obs⁻¹ᐟ² ≈ 10²⁶ m`.

Matching this scale requires:

`⟨‖∇χ‖²⟩ ≈ Λ_obs / (α δ₀²)`.

Assuming `α δ₀²` is of order unity, this implies a characteristic χ-variation
length of order the Hubble radius.

This result indicates **order-of-magnitude consistency** between FFT geometry
and observed cosmological data.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry  

This numerical consistency follows directly from χδ geometry:

- χ encodes large-scale causal curvature of the T-fiber bundle,  
- δ becomes increasingly smooth due to cosmic expansion,  
- ψ-divergence is therefore dominated by χ-curvature at late times.

Consequently:

- Λ is positive,  
- Λ is extremely small,  
- Λ varies slowly and asymptotically stabilizes.

Λ is thus a **geometric curvature average**, not an energy density.

---

## 5. Implications for Main Sections  

This appendix refines **Section 6** by clarifying that:

- the smallness of Λ does not require cancellation mechanisms,  
- the observed value naturally reflects the largest curvature scale
  accessible to observation,  
- late-time acceleration is compatible with smooth T-fiber relaxation.

No additional fields, vacuum energies, or modified gravity terms are required.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)  

This appendix contributes to the following open problems:

- **8.4.5** — Derivation of the cosmological constant Λ from χδ geometry,  
- **8.4.9** — Mathematical foundations of large-scale τ-averaging.

A rigorous derivation of the proportionality constant α remains open.

## 7. Summary  

Key points:

- Λ arises from ψ-divergence in χδ geometry, not from vacuum energy.  
- The required χ-curvature scale matches the Hubble radius naturally.  
- The observed smallness of Λ follows without fine-tuning.  
- Λ is positive, slowly varying, and asymptotically stable.

This appendix provides a **numerical plausibility check** for FFT cosmology and
serves as a draft foundation for future formalization.
