# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)  
This directory contains all supplementary materials for the FFT v1.2.x series.
The appendices provide mathematical proofs, perceptual models, cosmological
extensions, and experimental considerations that support the main manuscript.

This README explains **how to navigate the Appendix set efficiently** and  
**how each appendix relates to the main Sections (1–6)** of the theory.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Appendices
The main text of FFT introduces:

- χδ geometry  
- the generator field ψ  
- T-wave / C-wave dynamics  
- τ (phase-time)  
- quantum phenomena  
- curvature and cosmology

However、many key components require **additional derivations and examples** that are
not appropriate for the main flow of the paper.

Appendices serve as:

- mathematical proofs  
- extended derivations  
- perception/optics models  
- cosmological extensions  
- experimental proposals  
- cross-scale interpretations  

They are **not optional**; they are part of the complete formal structure of FFT.

# 2. How to Use These Appendices
There are two recommended reading modes:

### **A. Section-driven navigation（本文を読みながら Appendix で補完）**  
When reading Sections 1–6, use the **Cross-Reference Map** below to jump  
directly to the necessary appendix for that concept.

### **B. Domain-driven navigation（分野別に Appendix 群を読む）**  
Appendices naturally fall into 4 domains:

- **Foundations**（Z+0,1,2,18）
- **Observation & Time**（Z+6,7,9,13,14,16）
- **Optics & Perception**（Z+8,12,12B,37B）
- **Quantum & Cosmology**（Z+19,20,10,11,5,21,22）

# 5. Notes for Contributors
- All appendices must remain **self-contained**.  
- When updating a main section, update this README’s Cross-Reference Map.  
- Mathematical derivations should follow FFT notation standards (χ, δ, ψ, τ).  
- For new appendices, add an entry in Section 4 (Quick Jump Table).
