# Appendix β+2 — χ-Gradient Misestimation in Cosmological Inference  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5.1 Supplemental Material — Draft / Non-Canonical)*

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope  

This appendix provides a **draft-level geometric interpretation** of the
so-called *Hubble tension* within the framework of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

It supports **Section 6** and **Section 8.4.5** of the main text by addressing
the following limited goals:

- clarify how χ (causal-depth curvature) enters cosmological observables only
  through projection-level statistics,  
- show that different inference pipelines sample **different effective χ-gradients**,  
- demonstrate that a single scalar expansion rate need not correspond to a
  unique χ-statistic.

This appendix does **not** introduce a new cosmological model and does **not**
modify the canonical FFT dynamics.  
It concerns **measurement geometry and inference**, not the evolution of Ψ itself.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)  

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- χ — causal curvature injected along the Z-direction (causal depth),  
- δ — interference density on delayed projection planes,  
- ψ = χδ — appearance-generating information-gradient field,  
- τ — phase-time generated by interference stability.

The main text states:

> *Cosmic expansion corresponds to large-scale relaxation of T-fiber bundles,  
> while observed expansion rates are projection-level quantities derived from ψ.*  
> (Section 6)

Accordingly, cosmological observables never access χ directly.  
They access **τ-projected, interference-weighted statistics of ψ**, which may
encode χ differently depending on the observation scheme.

This appendix formalizes that ambiguity.

## 3. Main Model: χ-Statistics in Expansion Inference  

### 3.1 Setup  

Define the relevant fields:

- Ψ(x, y, z, t) — real T-fiber / T-wave field,  
- ρ(x, y, z, t) — information density derived from Ψ,  
- C(x, y, t) — τ-delayed observational projection,  
- ψ(x, y, t) — appearance field generated on the C-wave.

Cosmological expansion rates are inferred from large-scale statistics of ψ,
not from χ itself.

---

### 3.2 Effective Expansion Statistic  

At the projection level, an effective inferred expansion rate can be written as:

`H_eff^2 ∝ ⟨‖∇ψ‖²⟩_obs`.

At late times, δ is approximately smooth on cosmological scales, so inference
pipelines effectively reduce this to:

`H_eff^2 ≈ ⟨‖∇χ‖²⟩_Π`.

Here, Π denotes an **observation-dependent projection and aggregation operator**
that includes:

- spatial sampling volume,  
- τ-aggregation kernel,  
- smoothing scale and calibration procedure.

The inferred quantity is therefore not χ itself, but a **Π-weighted χ-statistic**.

---

### 3.3 Result  

The key result is:

- there is no unique scalar observable corresponding to “the” χ-gradient,  
- different observational strategies define different Π,  
- therefore they infer different effective expansion rates.

This is a geometric, not dynamical, non-uniqueness.

---

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry  

This result directly reflects core χδ geometry:

- χ governs causal-depth curvature in the real field Ψ,  
- ψ = χδ is the only quantity accessible to observation,  
- all cosmological observables are extracted from **τ-projected ψ statistics**,  
- averaging or smoothing ψ inevitably mixes χ information non-uniformly.

Consequently:

- expansion rate is **not a property of space itself**,  
- it is a projection-level statistic of χδ geometry.

---

## 5. Implications for Main Sections  

This appendix refines **Section 6** of the main text by clarifying that:

- discrepancies between expansion-rate measurements do not imply
  inconsistent cosmological dynamics,  
- they arise naturally from differences in χ-sampling geometry,  
- no modification of FFT-1, FFT-2, or FFT-3 is required.

In particular, this framework allows apparent tensions to exist
**without invoking new particles, exotic energy components,
or modified-gravity terms**.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)  

This appendix contributes to the following open problems:

- **8.4.5** — Derivation of cosmological observables from χδ geometry,  
- **8.4.9** — Mathematical foundations of τ and projection kernels.

A rigorous classification of Π-operators is required to elevate these arguments
to canonical status.

---

## 7. Summary  

Key points:

- χ is not directly observable; only projection-weighted statistics are.  
- Different cosmological inference pipelines apply different χ-sampling operators.  
- Apparent expansion-rate discrepancies arise from geometric misestimation,
  not from failures of the underlying dynamics.

This appendix provides a **measurement-level clarification** of FFT cosmology
and serves as a draft foundation for possible future formalization.
