# Appendix Z+4 — Low-Energy Quantum Limit of FFT  
## A Derivation of ΔZ ΔXY → Δx Δp

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides the mathematical bridge between the geometric uncertainty
relation of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) and the standard Heisenberg uncertainty
relation of quantum mechanics.

It demonstrates that quantum mechanics arises as the low-energy,
low-curvature limit of FFT through dimensional reduction of T-fiber geometry.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, observable geometry is obtained by projecting the full T-fiber field Ψ
onto delayed XY planes. This projection removes direct access to the Z-axis and
introduces an intrinsic loss of information.

As a result, FFT admits a purely geometric uncertainty relation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 FFT Geometric Uncertainty

The fundamental FFT uncertainty relation is

$$
\Delta_Z \cdot \Delta_{XY} \ge \Lambda_0.
$$

Here:

- $\Delta_Z$ measures hidden Z-axis curvature spread,
- $\Delta_{XY}$ measures spatial spread in the projected plane,
- $\Lambda_0$ is a geometric invariant determined by χδ coupling.

This relation is geometric rather than quantum mechanical.

### 3.2 Z-Axis Curvature and Momentum

Momentum in FFT is identified with the rate of Z-winding of emergent time τ:

$$
p \propto \partial_Z \tau.
$$

Accordingly, momentum uncertainty satisfies

$$
\Delta p \propto \Delta(\partial_Z \tau),
$$

which can be written as

$$
\Delta p \approx \frac{\Delta_Z}{L_\tau}.
$$

Here $L_\tau$ denotes the characteristic timescale of τ fluctuations.

### 3.3 Projection and Position Uncertainty

Projection onto the XY plane produces spatial blurring:

$$
\Delta x \sim \Delta_{XY}.
$$

This follows from the projection kernel

$$
C(x,y,t) =
\int
\Psi(x,y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z)\,dz.
$$

Finite Z-resolution forces Z-spread to appear as XY-position uncertainty.

### 3.4 Reduction to the Heisenberg Relation

Substituting the identifications

$$
\Delta_Z \approx L_\tau \Delta p,
\qquad
\Delta_{XY} \approx \Delta x
$$

into the geometric bound yields

$$
(L_\tau \Delta p)(\Delta x) \ge \Lambda_0.
$$

This implies

$$
\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\Lambda_0}{L_\tau}.
$$

Define the matching condition

$$
\frac{\Lambda_0}{L_\tau} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.
$$

The Heisenberg uncertainty relation

$$
\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

emerges as the flattened, low-energy shadow of the FFT geometric bound.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

This reduction occurs when:

- χ-curvature is weak,
- δ-interference is stable,
- ψ behaves approximately linearly,
- τ becomes approximately classical.

In this regime, FFT reduces to standard wave mechanics.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

- Section 4: uncertainty originates from projection geometry.
- Section 6: quantum behavior is an emergent limit of curvature dynamics.
- Section 7: decoherence corresponds to Z-axis divergence in ψ.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- the geometric origin of quantum uncertainty,
- τ-linearization regimes,
- breakdown conditions of quantum mechanics.

## 7. Summary

The quantum uncertainty principle is recovered in FFT by dimensional reduction:

$$
\Delta_Z \Delta_{XY}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\Delta x \Delta p.
$$

Quantum mechanics is therefore the low-energy effective theory of Fixed-Field
Theory rather than a fundamental description.
