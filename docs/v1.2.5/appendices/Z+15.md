# Appendix Z+15 — Quantum Entanglement as Zχ-Alignment  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a **geometric definition of quantum entanglement** within
Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

Its purpose is to eliminate nonlocal and observer-dependent interpretations by
showing that entanglement is a condition of **shared causal depth** defined
exclusively on the χ-side of the theory.

This appendix:

- defines entanglement as equality of causal depth $Z_\chi$,
- separates causal depth $Z_\chi$ from observational depth $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$,
- explains apparent nonlocality as a projection artifact,
- clarifies the relationship between entanglement, teleportation, and decoherence.

No Hilbert-space postulates or superluminal mechanisms are introduced.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT distinguishes two fundamentally different notions of depth:

- **$Z_\chi$** — causal depth accumulated in the T-wave (χτ domain),
- **$Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$** — apparent depth reconstructed through projection
  (XτZ / YτZ planes).

The generator field is defined as

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Only χ accumulates irreversible causal history.
δ governs interference and observation.
ψ is generated phenomenology, not a physical carrier.

Entanglement is therefore a χ-side condition, not an observational one.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Two Distinct Depths in FFT

#### (1) Causal depth: $Z_\chi$

- defined on the T-wave (χ),
- encodes accumulated causal history,
- independent of observation,
- not directly observable.

Formally,

$$
Z_\chi =
\int \omega_0' \, dt +
\Delta Z_\chi^{(\mathrm{interaction})}.
$$

#### (2) Observational depth: $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$

- appears only through projection,
- depends on propagation path and receptor geometry,
- manifests as apparent distance or depth.

Formally,

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \sim \tau_{\mathrm{arrival}}.
$$

This depth exists only in observation.

### 3.2 Definition of Entanglement (FFT)

Two systems $A$ and $B$ are **entangled** if and only if

$$
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}.
$$

This means:

- shared χτ accumulation,
- occupation of the same causal layer of the T-fiber,
- mutual consistency of ψ-generation.

No reference to spatial separation or observation is required.

### 3.3 Why Entanglement Appears Nonlocal

Observers have access only to $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$, not $Z_\chi$.

Thus,

$$
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}
\quad\text{while}\quad
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} \neq Z_{\mathrm{obs},B}.
$$

This mismatch produces the appearance of instantaneous influence.

Nonlocality is therefore a **projection artifact**, not a causal violation.

### 3.4 Measurement as Zχ-Divergence (Decoherence)

Measurement corresponds to interaction with an environment $E$:

$$
\chi_A \rightarrow \chi_A + \delta\chi_E.
$$

This modifies causal depth:

$$
Z_{\chi,A} \rightarrow Z_{\chi,A} + \delta Z_\chi.
$$

Once

$$
|Z_{\chi,A} - Z_{\chi,B}| > 0,
$$

shared ψ-generation is no longer possible and entanglement is lost.

This process is decoherence.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The χδ structure enforces strict role separation:

- χ governs causal accumulation,
- δ governs observational interference,
- ψ is generated where χ and δ meet.

Entanglement resides entirely in χ and is revealed only indirectly through δ.

This explains why entanglement survives spatial separation but fails under local
χ-perturbation.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies:

- **Section 3:** decoherence as divergence of $Z_\chi$,
- **Section 4:** observation as $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$-dependent ψ-generation,
- **Section 5:** apparent nonlocality as projection mismatch,
- **Section 7:** consciousness interacting with χ-selection, not ψ transport.

Misidentifying entanglement as a ψ- or C-wave phenomenon leads to category error.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.2** — full characterization of the G-operator (χ-band structure),
- **8.4** — low-energy reduction of quantum mechanics,
- **8.10** — conditions for consciousness in χδ geometry.

## 7. Summary

Quantum entanglement in FFT is defined by

$$
\boxed{
\text{Entanglement} = \text{shared causal depth }(Z_\chi).
}
$$

Apparent nonlocality arises from

$$
\boxed{
\text{misinterpretation of } Z_{\mathrm{obs}}.
}
$$

Decoherence corresponds to

$$
\boxed{
\text{divergence of } Z_\chi.
}
$$

FFT thus replaces quantum mystery with a precise geometric distinction between
causality and observation.
