# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

This directory contains all supplementary materials for the FFT v1.2.x series.  
The appendices provide mathematical proofs, perceptual models, cosmological
extensions, and experimental considerations that support the main manuscript.

This README explains **how to navigate the Appendix set efficiently** and  
**how each appendix relates to the main Sections (1–6)** of the theory.

# 1. Purpose of the Appendices

The main text of FFT presents the foundational concepts:

- χδ geometry  
- ψ (information-gradient field)  
- T-wave / C-wave classification  
- τ (phase-time)  
- quantum reinterpretation  
- gravitational curvature and cosmology  
- consciousness through the G-operator  

However, many of these require **extended derivations**,  
**mathematical formalisms**, **perceptual/optical modeling**,  
or **experimental proposals** that would disrupt the flow of the main text.

Therefore, the appendices serve as:

- mathematical proofs & operator formalization  
- examples and simulations  
- perceptual and optical geometry  
- cosmological extensions  
- quantum reinterpretations  
- experimental designs  
- cross-scale interpretations  

They are an **essential companion** to the main theory, not optional extras.

# 2. How to Use the Appendices

Two efficient reading strategies are recommended:

## **A. Section-driven reading**  
When reading Sections 1–6 of the main text, use **Section 4 (Cross-Reference Map)**  
to open the corresponding appendix as needed.

## **B. Domain-driven reading**  
Appendices fall into four natural domains:

### **1. Foundations**  
Z+0, Z+1, Z+2, Z+18

### **2. Time & Observation**  
Z+6, Z+7, Z+9, Z+13, Z+14, Z+16

### **3. Optics & Perception**  
Z+8, Z+12, Z+12B, Z+37B

### **4. Quantum & Cosmology**  
Z+5, Z+10, Z+11, Z+19, Z+20, Z+21, Z+22

# 6. Contribution Notes

- Appendices must remain **self-contained**.  
- When updating the main Sections (1–6), update this README’s cross-reference.  
- Notation must follow FFT conventions (χ, δ, ψ, τ).  
- New appendices must be added to Section 3 and to relevant cross-reference items.
