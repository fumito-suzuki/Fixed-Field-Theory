# Appendix Z+8  
## The Three-Layer Structure of FFT  
### (T-wave, C-wave, and ψ as Distinct Ontological Layers)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), physical reality is generated through the interaction
of **two wave-like layers** and **one generated geometric layer**:

1. **T-wave** — the continuous causal field (matter itself)  
2. **C-wave** — the interference field (information / light)  
3. **ψ** — the generated *phenomenon / geometry* produced by χδ  

These three layers form the minimal and complete structure required to explain:

- perception,  
- mass and solidity,  
- spacetime-like behavior,  
- quantum and cosmological phenomena.  

This appendix fixes their ontological roles and prevents category confusion
used in conventional physics.

## Z+8.1 T-wave: The Continuous Causal Field (Matter)

**Definition.**  
The T-wave is the continuous, persistent causal structure of the fixed field.
It corresponds to **matter itself**, not to a signal propagating through matter.

Properties:

- continuous and non-discrete  
- non-directional  
- not refracted  
- capable of storing irreversible history (Z-axis accumulation)  
- acts as a **receptor** for C-waves  
- determines solidity, inertia, and persistence  

In FFT notation:

$$
\text{T-wave} \;\equiv\; \chi(x,y,z)
$$

The T-wave should be understood as  
**“that which exists regardless of observation.”**

## Z+8.2 C-wave: The Interference Field (Information)

**Definition.**  
The C-wave is a directional interference field that carries *information* but
no causal curvature.

Examples include:

- visible light  
- infrared  
- radio waves  
- electromagnetic radiation in general  

Fundamental rule:

> **C-waves never carry χ.**

Thus:

$$
\chi_{\text{C-wave}} \equiv 0.
$$

Characteristics:

- directional and refractive  
- frequency-dependent  
- capable of superposition and interference  
- cannot exist as an *event* without a T-wave receptor  
- corresponds to the interference density δ  

Formally:

$$
\text{C-wave} \;\equiv\; \delta(x,y,t)
$$

C-waves are **pure information**.  
They do not create reality; they only *probe* it.

## Z+8.3 ψ: Generated Phenomenon (Not a Wave)

A crucial and strict distinction:

> **ψ is not a wave.  
> ψ is a generated phenomenon / geometry.**

ψ is defined by:

$$
\psi = \chi \delta.
$$

This means:

- χ (T-wave) provides causal grounding  
- δ (C-wave) provides interference pattern  
- ψ is the **phenomenon that appears at their contact**

ψ corresponds to:

- visible surfaces  
- object boundaries  
- shadows and highlights  
- texture and gloss  
- apparent depth and occlusion  
- mass-density gradients as experienced  

ψ does **not** propagate.  
ψ does **not** exist independently.  

ψ exists **only where and when** C-wave interference is received by T-wave
matter.

Thus, ψ should be understood as:

> **the appearance of reality**,  
> not as a physical substance or signal.

## Z+8.4 Relationship Between the Layers

The three layers relate as follows:

1. **T-wave (χ)**  
   — provides the causal substrate (matter).

2. **C-wave (δ)**  
   — provides directional interference (information).

3. **ψ = χδ**  
   — produces observable phenomena.

Symbolically:

$$
\text{matter (χ)} + \text{information (δ)}
\;\longrightarrow\;
\text{phenomenon (ψ)}.
$$

Examples:

- reflection = C-wave contacting χ at a boundary  
- shadow = absence of δ → ψ suppression  
- depth perception = Z-delay encoded in ψ  
- optical illusion = δ misalignment, not χ change  
- decoherence = divergence in χ-history affecting ψ stability  

All observable structure arises from this tri-layer interaction.

## Z+8.5 Why ψ Must Not Be Called a “Wave”

Calling ψ a wave causes categorical errors:

1. ψ does not propagate.  
2. ψ has no intrinsic frequency.  
3. ψ does not exist without χ and δ.  
4. The Sora Equation is a **geometry evolution equation**, not a wave equation.

Correct interpretation:

$$
\psi = \text{generated phenomenon / geometry},
$$

not a wave, signal, or particle.

This correction is essential for internal consistency across FFT.

## Z+8.6 Summary Table

| Layer | Ontology | Role | Symbol |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| **T-wave** | causal field | matter / receptor | χ |
| **C-wave** | interference field | information | δ |
| **ψ** | generated phenomenon | appearance / geometry | χδ |

## Z+8.7 Consequences for Later Appendices

This fixed distinction underpins:

- Z+12（C-wave observables）  
- Z+13（teleportation = arrival-time difference）  
- Z+15（entanglement with Zχ / Z_obs separation）  
- Z+16（decoherence as χ-history divergence）  
- Z+19（neutrinos as ultra-low-interference C-waves）  

ψ を「現象」として固定することで、  
FFT 全体の論理循環は完全に閉じる。

## Z+8.8 Final Statement

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{T-wave = matter} \\
\textbf{C-wave = information} \\
\textbf{ψ = phenomenon (appearance)}
}
$$

In FFT, reality is not built from particles or signals,  
but from the **contact between matter and information**,  
which generates the phenomena we call “the world.”
