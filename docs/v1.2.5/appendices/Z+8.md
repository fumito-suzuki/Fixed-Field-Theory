# Appendix Z+8  
## The Three-Layer Structure of FFT  
### (T-wave, C-wave, and ψ as Generated Geometry)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), observable reality arises from the interaction
between **two physical wave-like entities** and **one generated geometric
phenomenon**:

1. **T-wave (T-fiber)** — the continuous causal field (matter)  
2. **C-wave** — the interference field (information / light)  
3. **ψ** — the χδ-generated *appearance geometry* (not a wave)

These three layers constitute the minimal structure required to generate
perception, mass, and spacetime-like behavior in FFT.

This appendix formalizes their definitions and clarifies their **distinct
ontological roles**, emphasizing that **ψ is not a physical wave or field**.

## Z+8.1 Purpose and Scope

This appendix supports Sections 2–4 of the main text by:

- clearly separating ontic fields (T-wave, C-wave) from appearance (ψ)  
- preventing misinterpretation of ψ as a propagating wave  
- formalizing the tri-layer structure underlying perception and structure  
- ensuring consistency with Appendix Z+12 and the χδ axiom (Z+0)

## Z+8.2 T-wave: The Continuous Causal Field (Matter)

**Definition.**  
The T-wave is the continuous and persistent causal structure of matter,
represented as stacked causal density along the Z-axis.

Properties:

- continuous (non-discrete)  
- non-directional  
- not refracted  
- exists independently of observation  
- acts as a **receptor for C-waves**  
- determines solidity, inertia, and persistence  

Mathematically:

$$
\text{T-wave} \sim \chi(x,y,z)
$$

The T-wave should be understood as **matter itself**, not as a propagating signal.

## Z+8.3 C-wave: The Interference Field (Information)

**Definition.**  
The C-wave is the field of directional interference patterns that convey
information through interaction with matter.

Examples include:

- visible light  
- infrared radiation  
- radio and microwave signals  
- electromagnetic interference  

Essential property:

> **C-waves do not create matter.  
> They modulate appearance only through interaction with the T-wave.**

Characteristics:

- directional and refractive  
- frequency-dependent  
- absorbed or scattered by matter  
- corresponds to δ, the interference density  

Mathematically:

$$
\text{C-wave} \sim \delta(x,y,t)
$$

C-waves represent **information**, not substance.

## Z+8.4 ψ: χδ-Generated Appearance Geometry (Not a Wave)

A central clarification of FFT:

> **ψ is not a wave.  
> ψ is not a physical field.  
> ψ is a generated appearance phenomenon.**

ψ is defined by the χδ axiom:

$$
\psi = \chi\,\delta.
$$

Interpretation:

- χ (T-wave curvature) supplies causal weight  
- δ (C-wave interference) supplies pattern  
- ψ is the **observable geometry** produced at their interaction  

ψ determines:

- object boundaries and contours  
- surface texture and gloss  
- shadow and
