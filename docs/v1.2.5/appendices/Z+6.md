# Appendix Z+6 — Dark Matter as χ-Residual Curvature

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a geometric explanation of dark matter within
Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

Dark matter is not introduced as a new particle species.
Instead, it is identified as **residual causal curvature in the χ-field**
that remains gravitationally active even when observable interference
vanishes.

This appendix demonstrates how χ-residual curvature reproduces all known
dark matter phenomena without modifying gravity or adding exotic matter.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

The generator field in FFT is defined as

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Observable mass density arises from ψ-curvature,

$$
\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2.
$$

However, χ and δ play asymmetric roles:

- χ injects causal curvature,
- δ enables projection and observability.

As a result, χ-curvature can persist even when ψ vanishes.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 χ–δ Asymmetry and Residual Curvature

For observable matter, both χ and δ must be non-zero.
If interference collapses,

$$
\delta = 0,
\qquad
\chi \neq 0,
$$

then

$$
\psi = 0,
$$

while curvature remains:

$$
\mathcal{K}_{ij}^{(\chi)} =
\partial_i\partial_j \chi
\neq 0.
$$

This defines **χ-residual curvature**, denoted as

$$
\chi_{\mathrm{residual}}.
$$

Such regions are invisible in projection but remain gravitationally active.

### 3.2 Definition of Dark Matter Density in FFT

Define the χ-curvature energy density as

$$
\rho_{\chi}(x) =
\alpha_\chi \|\nabla\chi(x)\|^2.
$$

The dark matter density is then defined by volume averaging:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}} =
\alpha_\chi
\left\langle
\|\nabla\chi\|^2
\right\rangle_V.
$$

This quantity is positive, smooth at large scales, and independent of
interference structure.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

χ-residual curvature satisfies the following properties:

- it contributes to spacetime curvature directly,
- it is not projected into the C-wave,
- it does not require ψ to be non-zero,
- it is invisible to electromagnetic observation.

The absence of δ implies

$$
C = 0,
\qquad
\psi = 0,
$$

but does not suppress χ-curvature itself.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

### 5.1 Gravitational Effects

In regions dominated by χ-residual curvature, the Einstein tensor acquires a
direct contribution:

$$
G_{ij}^{(\chi)} =
\lambda
\left\langle
\partial_i\partial_j\chi -
\tfrac{1}{2}g_{ij}\Delta\chi
\right\rangle.
$$

This produces gravitational effects identical to those attributed to dark
matter.

### 5.2 Galactic Rotation Curves

In galactic halos, interference density decreases while χ-curvature decays
slowly, leading to

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}(r)
\propto
\|\nabla\chi(r)\|^2
\sim
\frac{1}{r^2}.
$$

This yields asymptotically flat rotation curves,

$$
v(r) \approx \text{constant}.
$$

### 5.3 Gravitational Lensing

Even when ψ vanishes locally, χ-curvature distorts geodesics of the emergent
metric,

$$
g_{ij}
\propto
\partial_i\Psi\,\partial_j\Psi,
$$

reproducing strong and weak gravitational lensing phenomena.

### 5.4 Structure Formation

As the universe expands:

- δ-interference becomes sparse,
- χ-curvature remains smooth,
- χ-residual wells seed large-scale structure.

This naturally yields filamentary clustering and halo formation without
particle dark matter.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- the geometric origin of dark matter,
- unification of dark matter and dark curvature,
- compatibility with Λ derivation via χδ geometry,
- elimination of particle-based dark sector assumptions.

## 7. Summary

Dark matter in FFT is identified as **χ-residual curvature**:

$$
\boxed{
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}} =
\alpha_\chi
\left\langle
\|\nabla\chi\|^2
\right\rangle
}
$$

Key properties:

- no electromagnetic interaction (δ = 0),
- genuine gravitational influence,
- flat rotation curves,
- gravitational lensing,
- cold, pressureless behavior,
- no new particles or modified gravity.

Dark matter is therefore a **purely geometric phenomenon** arising from
persistent causal curvature in the T-fiber.
