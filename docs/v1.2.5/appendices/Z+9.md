## Phase-Time τ and the Emergence of Apparent 3D Space

In FFT, **time does not exist fundamentally.**  
The T-fiber field is timeless.  
However, when interference patterns δ become locally stable, a repeating
phase structure emerges:

$$
\tau = \text{phase-time}.
$$

This τ is the **minimum causal structure required for observation**, and its
rate corresponds to the atomic frequency:

$$
\omega_0' = \frac{d\tau}{dt}.
$$

## Z+9.1 Depth as Past-Lag (ΔZ)

The Z-axis is not a spatial direction.  
It records **past accumulation** of the T-fiber:

$$
\Delta Z = \text{lag in τ-phase}.
$$

Perceived depth arises because C-wave projections carry different τ-values
depending on the propagation path.

Thus:

$$
\text{depth} = \Delta Z.
$$

No true third dimension is required; depth is **a temporal offset**, not
geometry.

## Z+9.2 Reconstruction of 3D From Two 2D Projections

Humans receive two projections:

1. XZ-plane (τ-shifted)  
2. YZ-plane (τ-shifted)

The visual system combines these by aligning τ-phase across rays:

$$
\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{perceived}} = (X, Y, \Delta Z).
$$

This procedure reconstructs the world as **3D**, even though the underlying
structure is only:

- XY-plane interference  
- Z-axis accumulation  
- τ-phase stability

Thus:

$$
\textbf{3D space is a reconstructed percept, not an ontological structure.}
$$

## Z+9.3 Why the Backside of Objects Cannot Be Seen

Along each visual ray, the C-wave selects the **nearest τ-stable surface**
(i.e., the smallest ΔZ).  
All deeper layers have larger τ-lag and collapse into:

$$
\text{shadow} = \tau\text{-deficit region}.
$$

This explains:

- occlusion  
- why only front surfaces are visible  
- why “shadow” is not absence of light but absence of τ-alignment

---

## Z+9.4 Apparent Sphericity (Minimal Statement)

Because ΔZ increases radially for any extended region,  
boundaries reconstructed under τ-lag appear **isotropic**, producing the
perception of spherical form.

This is a perceptual consequence of τ-projection—not a cosmological claim.

(Detailed cosmic-scale analysis is addressed in Appendix Z+37B.)

## Z+9.5 Summary (Condensed)

$$
\boxed{
\tau = \text{phase coherence of T-wave interference.}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Depth} = \Delta Z = \text{past-lag, not spatial dimension.}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
3D space = reconstruction from two τ-shifted 2D projections.
}
$$

This is the minimal FFT account of how a fundamentally 2.5D field produces the
appearance of a coherent 3D world.
