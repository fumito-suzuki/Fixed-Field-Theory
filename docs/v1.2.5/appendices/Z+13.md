## Quantum Teleportation as Arrival-Time Selection  
### (ψ Reconstruction via τ-Delay Reassignment)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum teleportation does not involve
state transfer, signal propagation, or nonlocal influence.

Instead, teleportation is a **purely temporal selection effect**:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Teleportation = selection of ψ reconstruction by arrival-time } \tau.
}
$$

No object moves.  
No wave travels faster than light.  
Only the **adopted τ-branch changes**.

## Z+13.1 Separation of Depth Concepts (Critical)

To avoid conceptual errors, FFT strictly separates:

- **$Z_\chi$** — causal depth accumulated in χ  
  → *used for entanglement (Z+15)*  
- **$Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$** — perceptual depth in 2.5D projection  
- **$\tau$** — C-wave arrival delay / phase-time  

This appendix concerns **only $\tau$**.

> Teleportation is a τ-phenomenon, not a Z-depth phenomenon.

## Z+13.2 Precondition: Wave Branching

Consider a χδ-generated C-wave:

$$
\psi \;\Rightarrow\; C.
$$

At an interaction point (beam splitter, Bell measurement), the C-wave branches:

$$
C \;\longrightarrow\; \{C_1, C_2, \dots\}.
$$

Each branch propagates independently and accumulates a **distinct arrival delay**:

$$
\tau_1 \neq \tau_2 \neq \cdots.
$$

No branch carries a “particle”;  
each is only a **candidate for ψ reconstruction**.

---

## Z+13.3 ψ Is an Event, Not a Carrier

In FFT:

- **particle = ψ (phenomenon)**  
- ψ exists **only when reconstructed**  
- ψ does not travel  

Thus teleportation cannot be “state transfer.”

Instead:

$$
\psi(x,y) \;\text{appears when a specific } \tau \text{ is adopted}.
$$

Different τ → different ψ-location.

---

## Z+13.4 Teleportation Step: τ-Selection

In the teleportation protocol:

1. Multiple C-wave branches exist with different τ  
2. A local interaction (Bell-type measurement) fixes **which τ is valid**  
3. All other τ-branches are discarded  

Formally:

$$
\tau_{\text{adopted}}
=
\min\{\tau_i \mid \text{constructive χδ reconstruction}\}.
$$

As a result:

$$
\psi_{\text{observed}}(x,y)
=
\psi(x,y;\tau_{\text{adopted}}).
$$

This **instantaneously changes where ψ appears**,  
even though nothing propagated.

---

## Z+13.5 Why Teleportation Appears Nonlocal

Observers track **ψ-events**, not C-waves.

Because ψ reconstruction switches between distant τ-branches:

- ψ disappears at one XY location  
- ψ appears at another XY location  

This is perceived as “instantaneous transfer.”

In reality:

> **Only the selected arrival-time changed.**

---

## Z+13.6 No Violation of Relativity

Key points:

- All C-wave branches propagate causally  
- No information travels faster than C-wave speed  
- τ-selection is local  
- ψ is not a signal  

Thus teleportation:

- does not enable superluminal communication  
- does not transmit matter or energy  
- does not alter χ-depth  

Relativity remains intact.

---

## Z+13.7 Relation to Entanglement (Z+15)

To prevent conflation:

- **Entanglement (Z+15)**  
  → shared $Z_\chi$ from wave branching  
- **Teleportation (this appendix)**  
  → τ-branch selection among already-propagated waves  

They address **different axes of FFT geometry**.

---

## Z+13.8 Physical Analogy: Eye Switching

Closing one eye and opening the other:

- light has already arrived at both eyes  
- the brain selects one arrival stream  
- the world appears to “jump”  

Teleportation follows the same logic:

> **ψ jumps because τ-selection switches, not because anything moved.**

---

## Z+13.9 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation is not transfer.}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{It is ψ reconstruction via arrival-time selection }(\tau).
}
$$

- Particle = ψ (event)  
- Wave = C-wave (propagation)  
- Selection = τ  
- Geometry = χδ  

Quantum teleportation is therefore a **temporal re-indexing of appearance**,  
fully explained within FFT without paradox or nonlocality.
