# Appendix Z+15  
## Quantum Entanglement as Z-Axis Alignment  
### (ΔZ = 0 as the Geometric Condition for Nonlocal Correlation)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum entanglement is not a mysterious
nonlocal influence but a **geometric condition**:

\[
\boxed{
\Delta Z_{AB} = |Z_A - Z_B| = 0.
}
\]

Two systems A and B are entangled precisely when they share the **same Z-depth**,
i.e., the same stacked time-phase τ accumulated along the Z-axis.

As long as this condition holds, their ψ-fields remain coherent even if
separated arbitrarily far in XY.

# Z+15.1 Z-Axis as Causal Focus Length

From Appendix Z+16:

- Z encodes **stacked microscopic time (τ)**  
- Z-depth acts as a **focus length**  
- Interference requires **identical focus** (ΔZ ≈ 0)

Thus, entanglement is simply:

> **Two systems whose Z-depths are perfectly aligned.**

This replaces the abstract “tensor-product nonfactorization” of quantum
mechanics with a concrete geometric criterion.

# Z+15.2 Definition: Entanglement = Shared Z-Depth

Let A and B have information densities ρ_A and ρ_B.

Define:

\[
Z_A = \int z\,\rho_A(\mathbf{r})\, d^3 r,
\quad
Z_B = \int z\,\rho_B(\mathbf{r})\, d^3 r.
\]

Then:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB} = 0
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
\text{entangled}.
\]

Because the ψ-field is generated by χδ:

\[
\psi_{AB} = \chi_A\delta_A + \chi_B\delta_B,
\]

if the components share the same Z-depth, they remain within the same
interference layer and therefore evolve coherently.

This produces the observed quantum correlations.

---

# Z+15.3 Why Entanglement Appears “Instantaneous”

The reason entanglement correlations ignore spatial separation is:

\[
\text{XY separation does not change Z-depth}.
\]

A and B can be kilometers apart, but if:

\[
Z_A = Z_B,
\]

their **projected ψ-fields remain synchronized**.

Thus the apparent “instantaneous influence” is not transmission but:

> **Shared Z-reference frame that both systems continue to occupy.**

This resolves the EPR paradox geometrically.

# Z+15.4 Measurement as Z-Axis Divergence  
### (The destruction of entanglement)

Measurement couples system A to an environment E, modifying its local χ:

\[
\chi_A \to \chi_A + \delta \chi.
\]

Through ψ dynamics (Sora equation), this perturbs Z_A:

\[
Z_A \to Z_A + \delta Z_A.
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB} = |Z_A - Z_B| > 0.
\]

Once ΔZ exceeds the coherence focus length:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB} > Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
\]

the systems can no longer remain within the same interference depth.

Interference terms vanish:

\[
\rho_{AB} \to \rho_A \otimes \rho_B.
\]

This is **entanglement collapse**.

---

# Z+15.5 Why Decoherence and Entanglement Loss Are the Same Phenomenon

From Z+16:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0
\]

under environmental contact.

Thus, if A is exposed to noise:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_{AB}
= \frac{d}{dt}|Z_A - Z_B|
> 0.
\]

Therefore:

> **Decoherence = entanglement decay = Z-axis focus mismatch.**

This unifies both phenomena under a single geometric law.

---

# Z+15.6 Entanglement Swapping and Bell Inequality in FFT

Bell-type violations arise because:

\[
Z_A = Z_B = Z_C = \dots
\]

for all participants in an interference network **before measurement**.

This creates a global Z-frame that XY-local observers cannot detect.

When swapped entanglement is used:

- The Z-alignment passes from A–B to B–C to C–D  
- XY observers see "spooky correlation"  
- But FFT sees:  
  **All systems temporarily share one Z-depth.**

Thus, nonlocality is simply:

> **Projection of a Z-global geometry onto XY-local slices.**

---

# Z+15.7 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} = \textbf{Z-depth alignment }(\Delta Z_{AB}=0)
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Collapse} = \textbf{Z-depth divergence }(\Delta Z_{AB}>Z_{\mathrm{coh}})
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = \frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_{AB} > 0
}
\]

Thus FFT replaces mysterious quantum nonlocality with:

- geometric Z-axis alignment,  
- projection effects on XY,  
- ψ coherence arising from χδ coupling,  
- and collapse as a natural geometric divergence.
