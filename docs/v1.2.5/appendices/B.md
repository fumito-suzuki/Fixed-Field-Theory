# Appendix B — The Fractal Laplacian Δᴰ in Fixed-Field Geometry

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.5.1 Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides additional mathematical and physical structure
supporting Sections 1–5 of the main text.

It addresses the following goals:

- clarify the exact definition of the fractal Laplacian Δᴰ,
- derive its relation to χδ scaling (a + b = D),
- connect Δᴰ to T-fiber geometry and ψ evolution,
- extend the results of Sections 1–5 to multi-scale structure formation
  and cosmological behavior (Λ scaling).

This appendix establishes Δᴰ as the formal mathematical expression of
**fractal causality** in Fixed-Field Theory.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the χδ axiom (Appendix Z+0) defines:

- χ — causal depth scaling exponent,
- δ — interference density scaling exponent,
- ψ = χδ — appearance field on delayed planes.

From this scaling relation,

$$
D = a + b
$$

defines the natural order of the fractal Laplacian Δᴰ appearing in FFT-1.

The main text states that non-local geometry and multi-scale curvature
emerge from χδ coupling.

This appendix formalizes that statement by identifying Δᴰ as the operator
encoding such non-local causal structure.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Mathematical Definition

For $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the fractal Laplacian is defined in Fourier space by

$$
\widehat{\Delta^D f}(k) =
-\!\left(|k|^{2D}\hat f(k)\right),
\qquad
0 < D \le 1.
$$

Its properties include:

- linearity,
- self-adjointness,
- negative definiteness,
- intrinsic non-locality,
- reduction to the standard Laplacian Δ when $D = 1$.

### 3.2 Riesz Kernel Representation

Equivalently, Δᴰ admits the real-space representation

$$
(\Delta^D f)(x) =
C_{n,D}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2D}}\,dy.
$$

This form highlights:

- non-local influence across multiple spatial scales,
- sensitivity to long-range curvature differences,
- divergence near singularities, leading to filamentary structure formation.

### 3.3 Result

The action of Δᴰ on ψ introduces:

- multi-scale sharpening of curvature,
- amplification of ψ-gradients,
- exchange between interference and depth curvature.

As a result, Δᴰ provides the operator-level mechanism for
nested and fractal geometries observed in FFT dynamics.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The operator Δᴰ encodes χδ scaling analytically:

- χ contributes depth curvature (Z → τ),
- δ contributes transverse interference,
- together producing a fractal order D.

Thus:

- non-local causality,
- multi-scale patterning,
- interference–curvature exchange

emerge naturally from Δᴰ acting on $\psi = \chi\delta$.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines the following sections of the main text.

### Section 2 — FFT-1

The hybrid operator

$$
\Delta +
\ell_D^{\,2-D}\Delta^D
$$

generates complementary behavior:

- Δ provides local smoothing,
- Δᴰ produces sharpening and fractalization.

This explains the emergence of filamentary and nested curvature
structures in Ψ.

### Section 3 — Irreversibility and Decoherence

The operator Δᴰ induces Z-direction superdiffusion:

$$
\Delta^D f
\sim
\text{super-diffusive spreading}.
$$

This provides a geometric basis for:

- decoherence through ΔZ growth,
- irreversible expansion in τ,
- spreading of causal depth χ,

without invoking probabilistic collapse.

### Section 4 — Perception and C-wave Geometry

Δᴰ enhances interference contrast:

- sharper ψ-gradients,
- stronger C-wave contours,
- consistency with delayed-plane projections (XτZ / YτZ).

Thus perceptual edges correspond to ψ-curvature amplified by Δᴰ.

### Section 5 — Quantum Limit

In small-curvature regimes:

- Δᴰ becomes negligible,
- FFT reduces to standard quantum mechanics,
- Heisenberg-like relations emerge.

This identifies the geometric origin of quantum behavior.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

The fractal Laplacian Δᴰ contributes to:

- **8.5** — derivation of Λ via χδ scaling,
- **8.6** — mass–energy balance in dark-curvature regions,
- **8.8** — ψ-dynamics instability and turbulence,
- **8.9** — τ-spreading and Z-depth measures.

## 7. Interaction with ψ = χδ

Because ψ is a product of non-commuting χ and δ fields,

$$
\Delta^D(\chi\delta)
\neq
\chi\delta\,\Delta^D,
$$

leading to:

- nonlinear exchange between curvature and interference,
- fractal amplification of $\|\nabla\psi\|$,
- emergence of spiral arms and filaments,
- interaction between χ-driven drift and δ-driven sharpening.

The nonlinear term in FFT-1,

$$
\kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2
\sim
\psi\,\Delta^D\psi,
$$

follows directly from this structure.

## 8. Cosmological Role (Relation to Λ)

FFT predicts the scaling relation

$$
\Lambda \propto |\gamma|^D,
$$

where $\gamma$ is the Z-propagation constant.

Since Δᴰ governs:

- fractal scaling of χδ geometry,
- large-scale curvature amplification,
- depth accumulation across τ,

it naturally leads to accelerated expansion.

## 9. Summary

Key points:

- Δᴰ is a fractional, non-local differential operator,
- it encodes multi-scale χδ causality,
- it explains filamentary curvature and ψ-contrast formation,
- it governs decoherence through Z-spreading,
- it reproduces quantum mechanics in the low-curvature limit,
- it links χδ geometry to Λ and cosmic expansion.

The fractal Laplacian Δᴰ is therefore a fundamental mathematical
component of the Fixed-Field Theory framework.
