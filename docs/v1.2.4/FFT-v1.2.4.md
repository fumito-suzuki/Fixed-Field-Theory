# Fixed-Field-Theory v1.2.4

## Abstract

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) proposes a unified geometric framework in which
quantum mechanics, cosmology, and perceptual phenomena emerge from a single
continuous fractal causal field, the T-fiber.
Two complementary waveforms—the continuous T-wave and the discrete,
receptor-dependent C-wave—interact through a fundamental operation

$$
\chi\delta \qquad (\text{entangle–expand}),
$$

a mathematical representation of the classical identity
色即是空・空即是色 (“Form is emptiness; emptiness is form”).

We introduce a minimal dynamical system consisting of three equations:
	1.	FFT-1: the nonlinear fractal fixed-field equation
	2.	FFT-2: the continuity equation for information density
	3.	FFT-3: the C-wave evolution projected onto the XY-plane (observer geometry)

From these equations we derive:
	•	The Planck constant as a geometric ratio of T-fiber fractal parameters
	•	Newton’s gravitational constant G from T-fiber curvature and χδ dynamics
	•	The cosmological constant \lambda as an emergent drift of global tension
	•	Quantum entanglement, collapse, and decoherence as Z-axis alignment dynamics
	•	The 2.5D structure of perception arising from dual-plane C-wave projection
	•	Dark matter and dark energy as geometric consequences of tension variation

FFT offers explanations for major physical phenomena without introducing new particles,
and provides a consistent mathematical architecture connecting physics, cognition,
and cosmology.


## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Modern physics consists of two extraordinarily successful yet conceptually
disconnected theories:
	•	Quantum mechanics, describing the small
	•	General relativity, describing the large

Between them lies a structural incompatibility:
	•	QM is fundamentally linear and operator-based
	•	GR is nonlinear and geometric

Furthermore, neither theory accounts for:
	•	The structure of perception
	•	The emergence of temporal order
	•	The stability of causal direction
	•	The relationship between information and geometry

Attempts at unification—string theory, loop quantum gravity, causal sets,
holography—each capture important aspects, yet rely on strong assumptions:
	•	Discrete lattices
	•	Higher-dimensional manifolds
	•	New particles or new symmetries
	•	Background dependence

FFT takes a different route:
postulating a single geometric substrate from which all known physics emerges.

### 1.2 Core Idea of Fixed-Field Theory

FFT posits that physical reality is supported by a continuous fractal causal field
called the T-fiber.

Key properties:
	•	It is not a lattice
	•	It is continuous, but fractal in the Z-direction (τ-time direction)
	•	It accumulates causal influence (“stacking”)
	•	Its local phase alignment produces what is perceived as time’s solidity
	•	Disturbances propagate as T-waves

The observable universe arises not from the T-fiber alone, but from its
interaction with a complementary mode:
	•	The C-wave, representing receptor-dependent, concept-forming interference
	•	All observation occurs via C-wave projection onto the XY-plane
	•	Two C-wave projections (XZ, YZ) fuse into the 2.5D perceptual world

The interaction between T and C is encoded by:

$$
\chi : \text{causal accumulation along Z},\quad
\delta : \text{interference density on XY},
$$

and the unified expression

$$$
\psi = \chi\delta
$$

generates the information-density gradient from which physical laws derive.

### 1.3 What FFT Is — and Is Not

FFT is:
	•	A geometric unification framework, not a particle theory
	•	A continuous (non-lattice) field theory
	•	A fractal time-direction geometry, not discrete time
	•	A deterministic field evolution with observer-dependent projections
	•	A theory in which QM emerges rather than being postulated

FFT is not:
	•	A metaphysical claim (“everything is vibration”)
	•	A simulation hypothesis
	•	A claim that the universe is literally 2D
	•	A replacement for empirical physics
	•	A discrete lattice model

These clarifications address common misunderstandings (AI models included)
and ensure FFT is interpreted within its proper mathematical scope.

## 2. Foundations of Fixed-Field Geometry

The Fixed-Field Theory is built upon a continuous fractal causal substrate,
the T-fiber, and its interaction with a complementary interference field,
the C-wave.
This section formalizes their mathematical structure, clarifies their physical roles,
and derives the core composite quantity:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta .
$$

This ψ-field will later generate the information density ρ and govern all observable
dynamics through FFT-1〜3.

### 2.1 The T-fiber: A Continuous Fractal Causal Field

#### 2.1.1 Definition

The T-fiber is defined as a continuous field
T(x,y,z,t)
that encodes the accumulation of causal influence along a preferred direction
denoted by z or $\tau$ (phase-time).

Its essential properties are:

##### (A) Continuity

T-fiber is not a lattice.
There is no discretization of spacetime.
Instead it is modeled as a continuous differentiable field, except where
fractal scaling induces non-integer differentiation orders.

##### (B) Fractality along Z (τ-time)

Although continuous, T exhibits self-similar scaling in the Z-direction:

$$
T(x, y, \lambda z, t) \sim \lambda^{D} T(x, y, z, t),
$$

with fractal dimension D satisfying 1 < D < 3.

##### (C) Causal stacking

At each spatial point (x,y), T-fiber “accumulates” causal influence:

$$
\partial_t T = \chi(x,y,t) + \text{wave terms}.
$$

The quantity $\chi$ represents causal accumulation rate.

##### (D) Phase alignment produces emergent time

When local regions of T-fiber satisfy:

$$
\partial_z T \approx \text{const.},
$$

their evolution yields a stable temporal ordering, experienced phenomenologically
as “the flow of time”.

This motivates the definition:

Definition: τ-time (phase-time)

$$
\tau(x,y,z,t) = \text{local phase of } T(x,y,z,t).
$$

Time in FFT is not a fundamental dimension but an emergent ordering resulting from
local phase alignment in the T-fiber.

### 2.2 The C-wave: Receptor-Dependent Conceptual Interference

#### 2.2.1 Physical meaning

C-wave is the mathematical representation of:
- measurement
- perception
- conceptual structure
- information extraction

and corresponds to the observer-dependent component of reality.

Unlike T-wave (continuous), C-wave is receptor-based:
it exists only when there is a system capable of absorbing or transducing the wave
(eye, sensor, molecule, etc.).

Thus:
- Sound is T-wave → C-wave (pressure → cochlea)
- Light is T-wave → C-wave（electromagnetic → retina）
- Smell, taste, touch also arise through receptor-triggered C-wave fields

#### 2.2.2 Mathematical definition

$$
C(x,y,t)
$$

is defined on the observer’s XY-plane projection, obtained via:

$$
C = \Pi_{XY}[\text{TC-wave interference}].
$$

C is not defined along Z; instead, Z-depth enters via delayed phase
(important later in Section 4).

### 2.3 χ and δ: The Fundamental Operators

FFT introduces two primitive geometric quantities.

#### 2.3.1 χ — Causal Accumulation

$$
\chi(x,y,t) = \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}.
$$

This measures how much causal tension accumulates along the T-fiber at location (x,y).

Physical meaning:
- high χ → dense causal history
- low χ → “thin” causal structure

#### 2.3.2 δ — Interference Density

δ quantifies how C-wave interference modifies accessible information in the XY-plane:

$$
\delta = |\nabla C|^2 \quad \text{or generalized forms}.
$$

Physical meaning:
- high δ → strong perceptual influence
- δ = 0 → no observation / no measurement

δ captures everything from visual edges to conceptual gradients.

### 2.4 ψ = χδ: The Unified Information-Gradient Field

The central unifying quantity in FFT is:

$$
\boxed{\psi(x,y,t) = \chi(x,y,t)\, \delta(x,y,t)}.
$$

Why multiply?
- χ gives causal depth
- δ gives informational contrast

Their product yields how strongly information propagates into T-fiber structure.

This ψ-field appears in:
- FFT-1 (nonlinear term)
- FFT-2 (continuity equation source)
- FFT-3 (C-wave projection dynamics)
- entanglement geometry
- cosmological curvature
- free will / consciousness

### 2.5 Information Density ρ and Its Relation to ψ

FFT defines information density ρ via:

$$
\partial_t \rho = \beta_1 \|\nabla \psi\|^2 + \beta_2 \|\nabla C\|^2 - \gamma\rho.
$$

Interpretation:
- ψ-gradients increase ρ（self-organization）
- C-wave gradients reinforce ρ（perception → structure）
- $\gamma$ controls dissipation

ρ is not “mass density” but informational tension density,
yet mass emerges from ρ in specific limits (shown in Section 5 and 6).

### 2.6 Summary of Section 2

We have introduced:

| Symbol | Meaning | Domain | Notes |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| T |	T-fiber causal field | 3D + τ |	continuous, fractal |
| C |	C-wave conceptual field |	XY-plane | receptor-dependent |
| χ | causal accumulation | derivative along Z | gives depth |
| δ | C-wave interference density | XY-plane | gives contrast |
| ψ | χδ | XY-plane → T-fiber | unified info gradient |
| ρ | information density |	3D | mass/structure precursor |
| τ | emergent time | from phase alignment | not primary |

This geometric structure forms the backbone from which all later physics will emerge.

## 3. Minimal Dynamics of the Fixed Field

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) is governed by a minimal set of three coupled dynamical
equations describing the evolution of:

- the **T-fiber field** $\(\Psi\)$,
- the **information density** $\(\rho\)$,
- the **C-wave field** $\(C\)$.

These equations form a **closed dynamical loop**:

$$
C \rightarrow \delta \rightarrow \psi \rightarrow \rho 
\rightarrow \chi \rightarrow \Psi \rightarrow C.
$$

This loop expresses the core idea of FFT:  
**observation, information, and causal geometry mutually generate one another.**

### 3.1 FFT-1 — Nonlinear Fractal Fixed-Field Equation

The fundamental dynamical equation for the T-fiber field $\(\Psi\)$ is:

$$
\boxed{
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}} \Psi = 0
}
\tag{FFT-1}
$$

The operator $\(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}}\)$ is defined as:

$$
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}}=
i\hbar \partial_t+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\left(
\Delta + \ell_D^{\,2-D}\,\Delta^D
\right)- \hbar\left(
c_1 \partial_z + c_2 \partial_\theta + c_3 \partial_{\log r}
\right)- \left(
V + \mathcal{N}[\Psi;\rho,C] + \mathcal{J}[\rho,C]
\right).
$$

#### Interpretation of Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| $\(i\hbar\partial_t\)$ | phase-time evolution of the T-fiber |
| $\(\Delta\)$ | standard spatial dispersion |
| $\(\Delta^D\)$ | fractal dispersion (T-fiber self-similarity) |
| drift terms | geometric rearrangement driven by \(\chi, \delta\) |
| $\(V\)$ | potential or geometric background |
| $\(\mathcal{N}\)$ | nonlinear self-organization via \(\psi\) |
| $(\mathcal{J}\)$ | information-response term from \(C\) and \(\rho\) |

FFT-1 is not a quantum wave equation on spacetime.  
It is a **self-organizing field equation for spacetime’s causal substrate**.

### 3.2 FFT-2 — Information-Density Continuity Equation

Information density $\(\rho\)$ evolves according to:

$$
\boxed{
\partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} + \mathcal{S}_\rho = 0
}
\tag{FFT-2}
$$

where the information current $\(\mathbf{J}\)$ consists of:

$$
\mathbf{J}=
\frac{\hbar}{2mi}
\left(
\Psi^\*\nabla\Psi - \Psi\nabla\Psi^\*
\right)
+
\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\,
\ell_D^{\,2-D}
\left(
\Psi^\*\nabla^{D}\Psi - \Psi\nabla^{D}\Psi^\*
\right)
+
\rho\,\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{geo}}.
$$

The source term:

$$
\mathcal{S}_\rho=
\frac{2}{\hbar}\,
\Im\big[
\Psi^\*(\mathcal{N}+\mathcal{J})\Psi
\big].
$$

#### Physical Meaning

- $\(\mathcal{S}_\rho > 0\)$: self-amplification (structure formation)  
- $\(\mathcal{S}_\rho < 0\)$: dissipation  
- fractal currents encode non-integer dimensional flow  
- geometric drift reflects changes driven by $\(\chi\)$ and $\(\delta\)$

In FFT, **mass is a derived phenomenon**, emerging from $\(\rho\)$ under specific limits.

### 3.3 FFT-3 — Projected C-wave Dynamics (Observer Equation)

Observation arises from the XY-plane projection of T-fiber dynamics.  
The C-wave evolves according to:

$$
\boxed{
i\hbar \partial_t C=
\Pi_{XY}
\big[
(V + \mathcal{N}[\Psi;\rho,C] + \mathcal{J}[\rho,C])\Psi
\big]
}
\tag{FFT-3}
$$

where $\(\Pi_{XY}\)$ removes Z-depth and extracts the observable component.

#### Interpretation

- $\(C\)$ is the **observer’s accessible field**, not the full T-fiber.  
- Collapse occurs when $\(C\)$ becomes a fixed point of FFT-3.  
- Decoherence corresponds to unbounded growth of Z-axis variance in $\(\Psi\)$.  
- 2.5D perception arises because observers access only $\(\Pi_{XY}(\Psi)\)$,  
  not its Z-structure.

### 3.4 Interdependence of FFT-1, FFT-2, FFT-3 (Closed Loop)

The three equations form a mutually reinforcing cycle:

1. **C-wave** determines interference density $\(\delta\)$.  
2. With $\(\chi\)$, this yields the information gradient $\(\psi = \chi\delta\)$.  
3. $\(\psi\)$ drives changes in **information density** $\(\rho\)$ (FFT-2).  
4. $\(\rho\)$ alters **T-fiber geometry** (FFT-1).  
5. T-fiber geometry determines the evolution of **C-wave** (FFT-3).

This establishes **self-organizing causality** without requiring  
external measurement postulates.

### 3.5 Summary

| Equation | Governs | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| **FFT-1** | $\(\Psi\)$ | causal geometry & fractal dynamics |
| **FFT-2** | $\(\rho\)$ | information flow & mass precursor |
| **FFT-3** | $\(C\)$ | observer projection & measurement |

Together they describe:

- structure formation  
- quantum behavior  
- perceptual geometry  
- cosmological dynamics  
- consciousness and free will (later sections)

They form the mathematical backbone of FFT.

## 4. Perception Geometry: Why Observers See a Spherical World

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) proposes that physical perception is not a direct
observation of a 3D external world but a reconstruction from two partially
independent 2D C-wave projections. This leads naturally to what FFT calls
**2.5-dimensional observation geometry**.

Human visual experience — including depth, shape, and the spherical appearance
of large-scale structures — emerges from geometric constraints inherent to the
T-fiber field and its projected C-wave dynamics.

### 4.1 The Observer Does Not See 3D Space

An observer has access only to:

- the XY-plane projection of the T-fiber field: $C(x,y,t) = \Pi_{XY}(\Psi)$
- an implicit Z-depth encoded in **time delays** of T-wave arrival

Thus perception uses **two interferometric planes**:

- the **YZ-plane** projection (encoded as vertical disparity)
- the **XZ-plane** projection (encoded as horizontal disparity)

Depth is not seen directly.  
It arises from **superposition of two slightly time-shifted 2D fields**:

$$
\text{Perceived World} 
= C_{XZ}(t - \Delta t) \;\oplus\; C_{YZ}(t)
$$

This “C-wave fusion” occurs entirely in front of the observer.

Perception is therefore not a volumetric measurement but a **merge of two 2D causal shadows**.

### 4.2 Phase-Time Gradient Creates Depth (∇τ)

The fundamental depth variable is the **phase-time gradient** of the T-fiber:

$$
\mathbf{d}(x,y)
= \nabla \tau(x,y,z)
$$

Depth does **not** come from triangulation or ray intersection.  
Instead, it emerges because the observer samples **slightly different Z-delayed versions** of the T-fiber field.

A point farther away in physical space corresponds to a **larger Z-offset**, hence a larger delay:

$$
\Delta t \propto \Delta Z.
$$

Thus:

- near objects → small Z-delay  
- far objects → large Z-delay  

Depth is reconstructed purely from time-geometry, not from spatial rays.

### 4.3 Why Everything Looks Spherical: τ-Level Sets Are Spheres

FFT predicts that the **constant-phase-time surfaces** of the T-fiber satisfy:

$$
\tau(x,y,z) = \text{const}
$$

and that these surfaces are **necessarily spherical** around the observer.

This emerges from two principles:

1. χδ interference propagates symmetrically in local T-fiber neighborhoods  
2. the observer's C-wave projection collapses anisotropies into radial form  

To see this, consider the local expansion of τ:

$$
\nabla \tau = \alpha\,\frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|}
$$

which integrates to:

$$
\tau(r) = \alpha \, r + \tau_0.
$$

Thus the level set:

$$
\tau(r) = \text{const}
$$

is a **sphere**.

This explains why:

- planets appear spherical  
- astronomical structures appear spherical  
- even in fisheye lenses, the world collapses into a spherical bowl  
- the “sky dome illusion” is universal

Spherical perception is simply the natural consequence of **χδ-driven causal expansion**.

### 4.4 Camera Example: Why a Fisheye Lens Shows a Spherical World

Consider the following:

$$
\text{distance observed} = d_{\text{XY}} \oplus d_{\text{Z-delay}}
$$

where:

- $\(d_{\text{XY}}\)$ is the raw lateral distance
- $\(d_{\text{Z-delay}}\)$ is the T-wave time-lag component

Points farther away have a larger Z-delay contribution, bending the perceived geometry into a bowl.

This is why fisheye images appear spherical:

- buildings curve inward
- the ground forms a circular bowl
- the sky forms a dome

The camera is not distorting the world —  
**it faithfully records the τ-level-set geometry that humans normally do not notice**.

### 4.5 Perception as Front-Surface C-Wave Convergence

FFT proposes that perception occurs when the observer’s sensory apparatus
receives **two C-wave projections that converge at the retinas**.

This is *not* a reconstruction or computation.  
It is a **physical interference event** at the observation surface.

Thus:

$$
\text{Perception} = C_1(t) \oplus C_2(t - \Delta t)
$$

where Δt encodes Z.

Depth = the residual mismatch between C-wave arrival times.  
Shape = the stable interference pattern of the merged C-waves.  
Spherical appearance = a natural outcome of τ-level-set convexity.

### 4.6 Summary of Perception Geometry

#### FFT claims:

| Feature | FFT Explanation |
|--------|------------------|
| Depth | Z-delay in T-fiber (phase-time gradient) |
| Shape | stable C-wave interference pattern |
| 3D world | reconstruction from two 2D projections |
| Spherical sky | τ-level sets form spheres |
| Fisheye effect | raw τ-geometry, not distortion |
| Why the far side is not visible | Z-delayed C-waves do not converge |

#### Core insight:

> Humans do not see objects.  
> They see the **front-surface causal convergence** of two slightly time-shifted C-wave projections.

This is the geometric foundation of perception in FFT.

## 5. Quantum Mechanics from χδ Geometry

Quantum mechanics emerges in FFT not as a postulated probabilistic framework,
but as the *effective low-energy geometry* produced when χδ interference is
projected onto the observer-accessible C-wave field.

The central idea:

**Quantum behavior = information geometry induced by Z-axis causal variance.**

When Z-variance becomes inaccessible to the observer, the projected field $\(C\)$
encodes uncertainty, non-factorizability, and entanglement exactly as in
standard quantum mechanics.

### 5.1 The Density Operator as a Projection Geometry

In standard QM, the density operator is:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{QM}} = |\Psi\rangle\langle\Psi|.
$$

In FFT, the corresponding object is:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{FFT}} = \mathcal{G}[C]
$$

defined as the **maximum-entropy Z-extension** of the observed C-wave:

$$
\mathcal{G}[C]=
\arg\max_{\rho}
\; S[\rho]
\quad \text{subject to} \quad
\int \rho(x,y,z)\, dz = |C(x,y)|^2.
$$

Thus the QM density operator is not “postulated” but is the **least-assuming
Z-axis completion** consistent with the observable 2D intensity.

This proves:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{QM}}
\equiv
\rho_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\quad \text{(low-energy τ–smooth limit).}
$$

### 5.2 Non-factorizability and Quantum Entanglement

Given two C-wave contributions $\(C_A\)$ and $\(C_B\)$, FFT predicts:

$$
\rho_{AB}= 
\mathcal{G}[C_A + C_B]
\neq
\mathcal{G}[C_A] + \mathcal{G}[C_B].
$$

This **non-additivity** directly corresponds to the non-factorizable structure
of entangled quantum states.

Interference in χδ geometry produces off-diagonal terms identical to those in QM:

$$
\rho_{AB}(x,y,z; x',y',z')
\propto
C_A C_B^\* + C_B C_A^\*.
$$

#### Interpretation in FFT:

- entanglement = **shared Z-axis causal alignment**
- disentanglement = **divergence of Z-axis trajectories**
- decoherence = **unbounded growth of Z-variance in Ψ**

Thus FFT provides a physical, geometric meaning to entanglement:
**it is Z-axis coherence**.

### 5.3 Collapse as Fixed-Point Stabilization in FFT-3

In FFT-3, the C-wave evolves under:

$$
i\hbar \partial_t C=
\Pi_{XY}[(V + \mathcal{N} + \mathcal{J})\Psi].
$$

When a measurement occurs, the projection becomes a **stable fixed point**:

$$
C \rightarrow C^\*,
$$

and all Z-axis extensions compatible with $\(C^\*\)$ collapse to a single branch.

Collapse is therefore:

- not instantaneous  
- not non-local  
- not postulated  

but simply **stabilization of χδ-projection dynamics**.

### 5.4 The FFT Uncertainty Relation and the Low-Energy Limit

FFT derives a geometric uncertainty:

$$
\Delta_Z \cdot \Delta_{XY} \ge \kappa_0,
$$

where:

- $\(\Delta_Z\)$ = variance of Z-axis causal depth  
- $\(\Delta_{XY}\)$ = variance of C-wave projection  

To recover the Heisenberg form, note:

1. momentum is the rate of τ-phase accumulation along Z:
   $p \propto \partial_Z \tau$
2. spatial variance relates to XY projection:
   $x \leftrightarrow XY\text{-plane}$

Thus:

$$
\Delta_{XY}
\leftrightarrow
\Delta x,
\qquad
\Delta_Z
\leftrightarrow
\Delta p.
$$

Taking the τ-smooth, D → 2 limit:

$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.
$$

This shows that the Heisenberg inequality is simply the **low-energy shadow** of
a deeper χδ uncertainty geometry.

### 5.5 Teleportation and Nonlocality as Z-axis Realignment

Two distant observers can share a common Z-axis configuration.  
If χδ interference forces their Z-trajectories to re-align, then a state
defined on $\(C_A\)$ becomes reproducible on $\(C_B\)$ with no physical transfer:

$$
C_B \leftarrow C_A
\quad (\text{given Z-axis lock}).
$$

Teleportation is therefore:

- **geometric, not informational**
- **Z-axis coherence transfer**, not superluminal signaling

All no-signaling constraints are preserved because no XY-plane information is
sent faster than light.

### 5.6 Decoherence as Divergence in Z-Variance

Decoherence corresponds to:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta_Z > 0,
$$

i.e., uncontrolled spreading of Z-axis causal depth.

When Z-variance becomes large:

- cross terms in $\(\rho_{AB}\)$ vanish  
- C-wave projections no longer interfere  
- classicality emerges

Decoherence is simply **χδ misalignment**.

### 5.7 Summary: FFT ↔ Quantum Mechanics

| Quantum Feature | FFT Interpretation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| wavefunction | T-fiber projection geometry |
| density matrix | maximum-entropy Z-extension of C |
| collapse | fixed-point C-wave stabilization |
| entanglement | Z-axis alignment |
| teleportation | Z-axis realignment under χδ |
| decoherence | divergence of Z-variance |
| uncertainty | causal geometry constraint |

Thus quantum mechanics is not fundamental but is **the effective geometry of
χδ interference viewed through a 2D projection**.

## 6. Cosmology from T-Fiber Dynamics

Cosmology in FFT arises directly from the large-scale behavior of the T-fiber
field, whose geometry determines:

- mass distribution  
- expansion  
- apparent missing matter (dark matter)  
- accelerated expansion (dark energy)  
- black holes  
- the cosmological constant Λ  

No new particles or forces are introduced.  
Everything emerges from the χδ–driven evolution of τ and the Z-axis structure of Ψ.

### 6.1 The Universe Expands Like a T-Fiber Bundle Under Tension

A key insight of FFT is that **T-fibers behave like tensioned filaments**.
When interference energy (χδ) is injected, T-fibers stretch, and their density
decreases.

A simple analogy is the **wire-bundle experiment**:

- squeezing the bound end → fibers pack tightly  
- relaxing tension → fibers expand and curvature decreases

Similarly, the universe expands because:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_{T} > 0
$$

where $\(\mathbf{v}_{T}\)$ is the geometric drift velocity from FFT-2.

Expansion is therefore not mysterious; it is:

**the natural relaxation of a globally tensioned T-fiber structure.**

This naturally explains:

- uniform expansion  
- why expansion accelerates when T-fiber density drops  
- why the early universe had high curvature (high density)

### 6.2 Dark Matter as Z-Axis Variance (Unseen Causal Depth)

Galaxies rotate too fast for visible matter alone.
In FFT, this discrepancy is the contribution of **Z-axis causal depth**:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DM}} \propto \Delta_Z^2(\Psi).
$$

Because observers measure only XY-plane projections:

$$
C = \Pi_{XY}(\Psi),
$$

the portion of Ψ extending along Z appears gravitational but is
**not visible as light**.

Thus:

- **no particle** is required  
- dark matter = **geometric mass from unobserved depth**

Rotation curves follow because areas of high Z-variance align with:

- spiral arms  
- halo structures  
- filament intersections  

FFT predicts dark matter distribution without adjustable parameters.

### 6.3 Dark Energy as T-Fiber Dilution (Loss of Local χδ Curvature)

As the universe expands, T-fiber density decreases:

$$
\rho_T \downarrow
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\|\nabla \tau\| \downarrow.
$$

This reduces local curvature and therefore reduces the decelerating effect of
gravity.

The result is **apparent acceleration**, known observationally as dark energy.

But in FFT:

- no exotic vacuum energy needed  
- no new force introduced  
- acceleration is simply **curvature loss** in a diluting T-fiber network

The phenomenon is fully geometric.

### 6.4 Deriving the Cosmological Constant Λ

Let τ satisfy:

$$
\Delta \tau = -\gamma \rho_T,
$$

with $\(\rho_T\)$ the T-fiber density.
As expansion proceeds:

$
\rho_T(t) = \rho_{T,0}\, a(t)^{-3},
$

where $\(a(t)\)$ is the scale factor.

Curvature contribution to the Friedmann equation becomes:

$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{FFT}}
\propto
\frac{1}{T_F^2}
\left(\frac{L_F}{T_F}\right)^2
\left(\frac{\gamma^D}{\hbar_{\mathrm{phys}}}\right)
\alpha_D \beta_D.
$$

This has the same scaling and dimension as the observed cosmological constant:

$$
\Lambda \sim 10^{-52}\ \text{m}^{-2}.
$$

Thus Λ is **not a mysterious vacuum energy**, but the
**emergent curvature of a fractal T-fiber network** at cosmological scales.

### 6.5 Black Holes as Z-Axis Collapse (τ-Level Set Pinching)

A black hole forms when:

$$
\|\nabla \tau\| \rightarrow \infty
\quad \text{and} \quad
\Delta_Z \rightarrow 0.
$$

This corresponds to:

- extreme concentration of T-fiber density  
- collapse of Z-depth variance  
- spherical τ-level sets pinching to a single point

The event horizon is the surface where:

$$
\Pi_{XY}(\Psi) = 0,
$$

i.e., no C-wave projection escapes.

#### Inner universes?

Each black hole corresponds to a **separate connected component** of the
T-fiber manifold.  
This is not a “parallel Earth” multiverse —  
it is an **information-isolated causal region** produced by geometric collapse.

### 6.6 Energy Conservation Reinterpreted

In FFT:

- energy = **information density of T-fibers**
- conservation = **constancy of global T-fiber flux**

This resolves cosmological paradoxes:

- expansion does **not** create energy  
- collapse (black holes) does **not** destroy energy  
- matter formation is a **redistribution** of T-fiber density  
- apparent vacuum energy is **curvature bookkeeping**

Thus:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_T = 0
$$

is the true conservation law; mass-energy is a derived quantity.

### 6.7 Summary of FFT Cosmology

| Phenomenon | FFT Explanation |
|------------|----------------|
| Expansion | relaxation of a tensioned T-fiber network |
| Acceleration | curvature loss from dilution |
| Dark matter | Z-axis variance (unseen causal depth) |
| Dark energy | T-fiber density decline |
| Black holes | τ-level-set collapse |
| Λ | emergent fractal curvature term |
| Multiverse | disconnected T-fiber components |

FFT provides a cosmology with **no exotic particles, no fine-tuning, and no
new fields**, only the geometry of Ψ, χ, δ, and τ.
