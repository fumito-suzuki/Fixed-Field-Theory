# Appendix Z+37B — Why the Observable Universe Must Appear Spherical  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix explains why **every observer in Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) must
perceive the observable universe as spherically symmetric**, regardless of the
true global topology or matter distribution.

This includes:

- the spherical Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
- large-scale isotropy,
- the apparent centeredness of each observer,
- equal-radius horizons in all directions.

The result is not a cosmological assumption.
It is a **geometric necessity** arising from the structure of phase-time $\tau$
and the causal geometry of the T-fiber.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, time is not fundamental.
It emerges as **phase-time $\tau$**, defined by the stability of T-wave
interference patterns:

$$
\tau = \tau[\Psi].
$$

The gradient of $\tau$ defines the local direction of causal becoming:

$$
\vec{n}_\tau \equiv \nabla \tau.
$$

Observation is restricted to intersections of:

- C-wave projection,
- T-fiber causal thickness,
- equal- $\tau$ hypersurfaces.

Thus, **what can be observed is controlled by the geometry of $\tau$**, not by
global spatial structure.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 τ-Isosurfaces and Their Geometry

Phase-time $\tau$ evolves according to

$$
\partial_t \tau = \omega_0' + \varepsilon(\nabla\psi),
$$

with isotropic leading term $\omega_0'$.

Because $\tau$ is generated by scalar diffusion over an effectively isotropic
T-fiber, its steady-state structure satisfies

$$
\nabla^2 \tau = 0.
$$

In three dimensions, regular finite-energy solutions take the form

$$
\tau(r) = A + \frac{B}{r}.
$$

The level sets

$$
\tau(r) = \text{constant}
$$

are therefore **spheres**.

Spherical $\tau$-isosurfaces are the **only non-singular global solutions** under
these conditions.

### 3.2 Light Propagation and Arrival-Time Geometry

All optical observation arises from C-wave projection:

$$
C = f(\Psi).
$$

C-wave packets propagate along $\tau$-gradients, and the observed arrival time is
the value of $\tau$ at the receptor.

Consequently:

- equal-arrival-time surfaces,
- equal-$\tau$ surfaces,
- observable horizons,

are identical geometric objects.

Thus the surface of last scattering satisfies

$$
\tau = \tau_{\mathrm{CMB}},
$$

and must appear as a **perfect sphere** centered on the observer.

### 3.3 Observer-Centered Sphericity

Let an observer follow a worldline $O$.
The set

$$
\{ x : \tau(x) = \tau_0 - \Delta\tau \}
$$

is a sphere centered on $O$.

A different observer $O'$ possesses a different $\tau$ field, whose level sets
are centered on $O'$.

Thus every observer necessarily perceives:

- themselves at the center,
- isotropy in all directions,

without implying any privileged global position.

This resolves the apparent paradox of universal centeredness.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The spherical appearance arises from χδ geometry alone:

- χ governs causal accumulation,
- δ governs interference and projection,
- $\psi$ mediates their interaction,
- $\tau$ emerges from $\psi$ stability.

Because $\tau$ is scalar and diffusive, its level sets are constrained to be
spherical under regularity conditions.

Global topology, boundary shape, or matter distribution do not affect this
result.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies that:

- CMB isotropy does not require inflation,
- horizons are inevitable geometric features,
- large-scale isotropy is observer-centered but not anthropic,
- apparent cosmic symmetry does not imply global homogeneity.

Small anisotropies arise naturally from:

- χ-residual curvature,
- ψ-divergence fluctuations,
- T-fiber thickness modulation,

as discussed in Appendices Z+6 and Z+7.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.4** — global observational geometry in FFT,
- **8.7** — horizon structure without inflation,
- **8.12** — separation of global topology from observable geometry.

It also complements Appendix Z+11, which addresses *local* perceptual geometry,
by providing the **cosmological-scale counterpart**.

## 7. Summary

In Fixed-Field Theory:

- $\tau$ -isosurfaces are necessarily spherical,
- all optical observation follows $\nabla\tau$,
- observable horizons are compact, spherical, and observer-centered,
- isotropy is geometric, not dynamical,
- global topology is observationally irrelevant.

Therefore:

$$
\boxed{
\text{The universe does not merely appear spherical.}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{It can only appear spherical.}
}
$$
