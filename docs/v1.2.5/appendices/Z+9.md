# Appendix Z+9 — Phase-Time τ and the Emergence of Apparent 3D Space  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix formalizes the concept of **phase-time $\tau$** in Fixed-Field
Theory (FFT) and explains how apparent three-dimensional space emerges from a
fundamentally lower-dimensional structure.

Its purpose is to clarify:

- why time is not fundamental in FFT,
- how $\tau$ arises from stable interference,
- how depth is encoded as past-lag $\Delta Z$,
- how apparent 3D space is reconstructed from $\tau$-shifted projections.

This appendix provides the minimal geometric framework required to interpret
Sections 3 and 4 of the main text.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, the T-fiber field is fundamentally timeless.
No external or absolute time parameter is assumed.

When interference patterns $\delta$ become locally stable, a repeating phase
structure emerges.
This structure defines **phase-time**:

$$
\tau = \text{phase-time}.
$$

The rate of $\tau$ is fixed by the atomic reference frequency:

$$
\omega_0' = \frac{d\tau}{dt}.
$$

Phase-time $\tau$ constitutes the minimal causal structure required for
observation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Depth as Past-Lag ($\Delta Z$)

The Z-axis in FFT is not a spatial direction.
It records accumulated causal history of the T-fiber.

Depth is defined as

$$
\Delta Z = \text{lag in }\tau\text{-phase}.
$$

C-wave projections carry different $\tau$ values depending on their propagation
history.
Perceived depth arises from these $\tau$-lags.

Thus,

$$
\text{depth} = \Delta Z.
$$

No independent third spatial dimension is required.
Depth is a temporal offset encoded in phase structure.

### 3.2 Reconstruction of Apparent 3D Space

Observation receives two $\tau$-shifted projections:

1. an $XZ$-plane projection,
2. a $YZ$-plane projection.

The perceptual reconstruction aligns $\tau$-phase across rays and assigns
position as

$$
\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{perceived}} = (X, Y, \Delta Z).
$$

This procedure produces the appearance of three-dimensional space, even though
the underlying structure consists only of:

- XY-plane interference,
- Z-axis causal accumulation,
- $\tau$-phase stability.

Therefore,

$$
\text{3D space is a reconstructed percept, not an ontological structure}.
$$

### 3.3 Occlusion and the Visibility of Surfaces

Along each observational ray, the C-wave selects the nearest $\tau$-stable
surface, corresponding to the smallest $\Delta Z$.

Deeper layers possess larger $\tau$-lag and fail phase alignment, collapsing into
a $\tau$-deficit region:

$$
\text{shadow} = \tau\text{-deficit region}.
$$

This accounts for:

- occlusion,
- visibility of only front-facing surfaces,
- shadows as regions of $\tau$-misalignment rather than absence of light.

### 3.4 Apparent Sphericity

For any extended region, $\Delta Z$ increases radially.
Under $\tau$-based reconstruction, boundaries appear isotropic, producing the
perception of spherical form.

This is a perceptual consequence of $\tau$-projection geometry, not a
cosmological statement.

Cosmic-scale sphericity is addressed separately in Appendix Z+37B.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Phase-time $\tau$ emerges only when χ and δ jointly produce stable ψ.

Depth reconstruction relies on:

- χ-history accumulation along Z,
- δ-mediated phase coherence,
- ψ-stability under projection.

$\tau$ therefore provides the bridge between causal structure and perceptual
geometry.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix fixes key interpretations in the main text:

- **Section 3 (Irreversibility):**  
  irreversibility arises from accumulation of $\Delta Z$.

- **Section 4 (Observation and Perception):**  
  depth perception is $\tau$-based reconstruction, not spatial sensing.

- **Section 7 (Consciousness):**  
  stable consciousness requires $\tau$-coherent χ-selection.

Misinterpreting Z as a spatial axis breaks consistency across these sections.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.3** — formal definition of phase-time without external clocks,
- **8.7** — limits of $\tau$-reconstruction under high curvature,
- **8.9** — relation between $\Delta Z$ accumulation and decoherence,
- **8.12** — perceptual versus cosmological sphericity separation.

These problems concern scale separation and reconstruction limits.

## 7. Summary

Phase-time $\tau$ is defined as coherence of T-fiber interference:

$$
\boxed{
\tau = \text{phase coherence of T-fiber interference}.
}
$$

Depth is encoded as past-lag:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Depth} = \Delta Z = \text{past-lag, not a spatial dimension}.
}
$$

Apparent three-dimensional space arises from reconstruction:

$$
\boxed{
\text{3D space} =
\text{alignment of two }\tau\text{-shifted 2D projections}.
}
$$

A fundamentally 2.5D χδ structure therefore produces the appearance of a
coherent 3D world through phase-time geometry.
