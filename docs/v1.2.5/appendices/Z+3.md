# Appendix Z+3 — Projection Operator *f* and the Geometry of 2.5D Perception

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a formal derivation of the **projection operator**

$$
C = f(\Psi),
$$

which maps the three-dimensional T-fiber geometry
$\Psi(x,y,z,t)$ onto the perceptual field $C(x,y,t)$.

It supports **Section N** of the main text by:

- clarifying why human perception does **not** reconstruct full 3D geometry
- deriving perception as an interference-based projection, not inversion
- connecting $\chi$, $\delta$, $\psi$, and $\tau$ to apparent depth formation
- explaining why perception exhibits an effective dimensionality of $2.5$

---

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Within Fixed-Field Theory, perception arises from the interaction of the
following quantities:

- $\chi$ — causal curvature injection
- $\delta$ — interference density
- $\psi = \chi\delta$ — information-gradient field
- $\tau$ — phase-time generated by interference stability

The main text states:

> *Human perception does not recover three-dimensional structure, but stabilizes
> a lower-dimensional representation through interference delays.*

This appendix formalizes that statement by introducing a **projection operator**
that maps T-fiber geometry into perceptual space.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Setup

Let the ontic field be given by:

$$
\Psi(x,y,z,t),
$$

representing the T-fiber geometry.

Define the perceptual field:

$$
C(x,y,t),
$$

which lacks an independent Z-axis but encodes depth implicitly via phase delay.

---

### 3.2 Key Equations

Define two Z-dependent projections of $\Psi$:

- XZ-plane projection: $\Pi_{XZ}[\Psi]$
- YZ-plane projection: $\Pi_{YZ}[\Psi]$

Introduce the Z-axis delay:

$$
\tau_Z(x,y,z)
=
\frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}},
$$

where $c_{\mathrm{eff}}$ denotes the effective C-wave propagation velocity.

The projection operator is defined as:

$$
C(x,y,t)
=
f(\Psi)
=
\mathcal{I}
\Big(
\Pi_{XZ}[\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)],
\;
\Pi_{YZ}[\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)]
\Big),
$$

with:

$$
f = \mathcal{I}\circ(\Pi_{XZ},\Pi_{YZ}).
$$

The operator is:

- nonlinear
- phase-sensitive
- Z-delay dependent
- based on bi-projection interference

---

### 3.3 Result

The interference operator $\mathcal{I}$ is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{I}(A,B)(x,y,t)
=
\int dz\;
A(x,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
B(y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z),
$$

where $K(z)$ is a depth-weighting kernel that:

- peaks at the interference minimum
- suppresses unstable depth contributions
- ensures perceptual coherence

A minimal example is:

$$
K(z) = \exp(-\alpha z^2),
$$

though FFT does not require Gaussian kernels.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

This formulation directly supports the χδ structure of FFT:

- $\chi$ injects causal curvature along the Z-axis
- $\delta$ controls interference density across projections
- $\psi$ gradients determine perceptual stability
- $\tau$ emerges as a measurable Z-delay

The perceptual mass-density correspondence:

$$
\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2
$$

remains consistent with the projection-based model.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines Section **N** by clarifying:

- why depth is *experienced* rather than reconstructed
- why perception cannot freely rotate Z-structure
- why objects appear opaque without photon absorption
- why perceptual geometry differs from classical optics

Specifically:

> These results demonstrate that the phenomenon described in Section N
> is a direct consequence of $\chi\delta$-mediated interference under Z-delay
> boundary conditions.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.X** — the origin of perceptual dimensionality
- **8.Y** — the relationship between $\tau$-geometry and observation
- **8.Z** — the distinction between ontic and perceptual fields

Thus, Appendix Z+3 remains structurally integrated with FFT development.

---

## 7. Summary

Key points:

- perception is a **projection**, not inverse reconstruction
- depth arises from Z-axis phase delay $\tau$
- the projection operator $f$ is interference-based
- perceptual space has effective dimension $2.5$
- spherical appearance and opacity follow naturally

This appendix extends the χδ–ψ geometry of FFT and provides a precise,
minimal mathematical foundation for perception as an **active convergence
process**, rather than an optical reconstruction.
