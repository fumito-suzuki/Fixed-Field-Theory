# 📚 Appendix Guide — Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)  
This directory contains all supplementary materials for the FFT v1.2.x series.  
The appendices provide mathematical proofs, perceptual models, cosmological
extensions, and experimental considerations that support the main manuscript.

This README explains:

- how to navigate the Appendix set efficiently  
- how each appendix relates to Sections 1–6 of FFT  
- how appendices map to the **Open Problems** in Section 8  

Appendices are **not optional**; they are structural components of the theory.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Appendices
The main text of FFT introduces:

- χδ geometry  
- the generator field ψ  
- T-wave / C-wave dynamics  
- τ (phase-time)  
- quantum phenomena  
- curvature and cosmology  

Many of these require **extended derivations** or **mathematical proofs** that
do not belong in the flow of the main manuscript.

Appendices serve as:

- mathematical foundations  
- perceptual / optical models  
- cosmological generalizations  
- quantum-limit derivations  
- experimental proposals  
- consciousness and Z-axis models  

They form the **technical backbone** of the theory.

# 2. How to Use These Appendices

## A. Section-driven navigation  
Read Sections 1–6 of the main text and jump into the appendix that provides  
the deeper mathematical or physical justification.

## B. Domain-driven navigation  
Appendices naturally cluster into four logical domains:

### **Foundations**
Z+0, Z+1, Z+2, Z+18  
Core χδ geometry, ψ definition, τ origin, projection/extension operators.

### **Observation & Time**
Z+6, Z+7, Z+9, Z+13, Z+14, Z+16, Z+17  
Collapse, decoherence, τ-delay, binocular perception, observer-free observation.

### **Optics & Perception**
Z+8, Z+12, Z+12B, Z+37B  
ψ-wave optics, C-wave observables, C-wave experimental design, spherical τ-geometry.

### **Quantum & Cosmology**
Z+3, Z+4, Z+5, Z+10, Z+11, Z+19, Z+20, Z+22, Z+37B  
Quantum potential, QFT limit, Λ geometry, dark matter/energy, neutrino-like C-wave.

# 6. Notes for Contributors

- All appendices must remain **self-contained**.  
- Updating any main-section claim requires updating this README’s maps.  
- Notation must follow FFT standards (χ, δ, ψ, τ).  
- New appendices should extend the Quick Jump Table and Cross-Reference Map.
