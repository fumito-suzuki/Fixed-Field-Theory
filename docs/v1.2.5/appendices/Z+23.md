# Appendix Z+23 — Probability and the Born Rule in Fixed-Field Theory  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a **non-axiomatic derivation of probability** within
Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

It addresses the central foundational objection:

> Where does probability come from, if $\psi$ is not a wavefunction  
> and no Born rule is postulated?

FFT shows that:

- probability is **not fundamental**,
- it emerges from **projection geometry and information loss**,
- the Born rule appears as a **maximum-entropy consequence**
  of projection and reconstruction.

No new physical postulates are introduced.
Probability is formalized as an emergent statistical property of observation.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT strictly distinguishes:

- χ — causal accumulation on the T-wave (not observable),
- δ — interference structure on the C-wave (observable),
- $\psi = \chi\delta$ — generated appearance,
- $\tau$ — phase-time (arrival delay),
- $Z_\chi$ — causal depth (coherence),
- $Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$ — observational depth (projection delay).

Observation is governed by two operators (Appendix Z+18):

Projection:
$$
C = f\Psi.
$$

Reconstruction:
$$
\rho = G\Psi = f^\dagger f \Psi.
$$

The observer never accesses the full causal field $\Psi$,
only the projected data $C$.

Probability arises from this **irreducible loss of causal information**.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Absence of Primitive Probability

FFT does not assume:

- intrinsic randomness,
- stochastic collapse,
- probabilistic axioms,
- the Born rule as a postulate.

Instead,

$$
\boxed{
\text{Probability in FFT emerges from projection-induced degeneracy.}
}
$$

Distinct causal configurations of $\Psi$ can yield the **same observable
projection** $C$.

### 3.2 Projection Degeneracy

Let:

- $\Psi$ be the full T-fiber causal field,
- $f$ the projection operator,
- $C = f\Psi$ the observable outcome.

The preimage of $C$ is

$$
\mathcal{P}(C)
=
\{ \Psi_i \mid f\Psi_i = C \}.
$$

This set contains many distinct causal states.
Observation cannot distinguish among them.

### 3.3 Maximum-Entropy Reconstruction

FFT defines the reconstructed internal state as the
maximum-entropy extension consistent with $C$:

$$
\rho
=
\arg\max_{\rho}
\left\{
- \int \rho \log \rho \, dV
\right\}
$$

subject to the marginal constraint

$$
\int \rho(x,y,z)\,dz = |C(x,y)|^2.
$$

This reconstruction is not optional.
Any alternative would introduce unjustified information.

The result is

$$
\rho = f^\dagger f \Psi.
$$

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Within χδ geometry:

- χ encodes causal multiplicity,
- δ encodes projection structure,
- $\psi$ is generated locally but does not propagate,
- probability reflects **how many χ-histories project identically**.

Thus probability is geometric, not ontological.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

### 5.1 Emergence of the Born Rule

Repeated experiments sample the ensemble of causal preimages
$\mathcal{P}(C_i)$.

The frequency of outcome $C_i$ is proportional to the measure of its compatible
causal volume:

$$
P(C_i)
\propto
\int_{\mathcal{P}(C_i)} d\Psi.
$$

Under maximum-entropy reconstruction, this reduces to

$$
\boxed{
P(C_i) = \int |C_i|^2 \, dA.
}
$$

This is exactly the Born rule.

### 5.2 Collapse and Decoherence

Collapse corresponds to **local χ-interaction**:

- ψ is generated at one receptor,
- Z-history is locally fixed,
- alternative projections become causally inaccessible.

Decoherence corresponds to **divergence of causal depth $Z_\chi$**
(Appendix Z+16):

- interference becomes unstable,
- projection degeneracy increases,
- classical probability distributions emerge.

Probability plays no causal role.
It describes **pre-collapse statistical expectation only**.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.1** — observer-independent projection logic,
- **8.2** — structure of the reconstruction operator $G$,
- **8.5** — emergence of classical probability from large $Z_\chi$,
- **8.10** — Bell correlations from shared causal depth.

Probability would disappear only if the full T-fiber causal field were
accessible, which is geometrically impossible.

## 7. Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Probability in FFT is not fundamental.}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{The Born rule emerges from projection geometry and maximum entropy.}
}
$$

- $\psi$ is not a wavefunction,
- no probabilistic axiom is assumed,
- measurement statistics arise from projection-induced information loss,
- quantum probability is an emergent geometric phenomenon.

Probability is therefore unavoidable for observers,
yet unnecessary at the fundamental χδ level.
