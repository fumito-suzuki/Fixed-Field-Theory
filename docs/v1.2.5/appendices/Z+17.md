# Appendix Z+17  
## Heisenberg Uncertainty as the Low-Energy Projection of FFT Uncertainty  
### (From Z-Axis Focus Spread to Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2)

In FFT, physical reality is three-layered:

- **T-wave (χ):** causal curvature / matter field  
- **C-wave (δ):** interference field  
- **ψ:** generator field combining χδ  

But **observation** always occurs on the XY-plane:

\[
\Pi_{XY} : (x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y).
\]

Because the Z-axis encodes **stacked time (atomic oscillation phase τ)**,  
any Z-spread (focus spread):

\[
\Delta Z > 0
\]

necessarily introduces *projection ambiguity* on XY.

This projection ambiguity is what appears in physics as  
**Heisenberg uncertainty.**

# Z+17.1 FFT Uncertainty: Origin in Z-Axis Focus Spread

From Appendix Z+16:

\[
\boxed{
\text{FFT uncertainty} \;\equiv\; \Delta Z
= \text{spread in causal depth (focus length)}.
}
\]

Z-depth is defined as:

\[
Z = \omega_0' t + \text{local χδ contribution}.
\]

Environmental contact or measurement leads inevitably to:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
\]

Thus, **uncertainty begins in Z, not XY.**

# Z+17.2 How Projection Creates XY Uncertainty

Observation is a projection:

\[
(x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y).
\]

If Z is uncertain, then the projected XY image is uncertain:

\[
\Delta Z \;\Longrightarrow\; \Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta p_x, \Delta p_y.
\]

To see why, note that the **wavevector** of a C-wave is:

\[
\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z).
\]

But momentum is observed only in XY:

\[
p_x = \hbar k_x, \quad p_y = \hbar k_y.
\]

If Z-depth fluctuates, then the apparent angle of propagation fluctuates:

\[
k_x = |\mathbf{k}| \cos\theta,
\quad
k_z = |\mathbf{k}|\sin\theta,
\]

and \(\theta\) depends on Z.

Differentiating:

\[
\Delta k_x \sim |k| \, \Delta\theta
\sim |k| \frac{\Delta Z}{L_Z},
\]

where \(L_Z\) is the focal coherence length.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\Delta p_x \propto \Delta Z.
}
\]

Similarly, the transverse spread in the projected position is:

\[
\Delta x \propto \Delta Z.
\]

Putting these together:

\[
\Delta x \, \Delta p_x \propto (\Delta Z)^2.
\]

# Z+17.3 Low-Energy Limit: Recovering Heisenberg

In the **low-energy / long-wavelength** regime:

- Z-depth variation is small compared to the atomic scale,
- χδ variations average out,
- ψ is approximately Gaussian.

Then:

\[
\Delta Z \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}},
\]

(where ω is local effective curvature frequency).

Plugging into:

\[
\Delta x \propto \Delta Z, \qquad
\Delta p_x \propto \Delta Z,
\]

yields:

\[
\Delta x \, \Delta p_x
\approx
\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\Delta x\,\Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
}
\]

appears as the **projection of FFT uncertainty** onto XY at low energies.

No operator algebra or postulates are required.

# Z+17.4 Physical Interpretation

This gives a concrete geometric meaning to quantum uncertainty:

> **Uncertainty is not intrinsic to nature.  
It is a projection artifact caused by not knowing the exact Z-depth.**

In other words:

- If Z (focus length) is fixed → no uncertainty  
  → classical trajectory limit  
- If Z spreads → XY appears fuzzy  
  → quantum regime  
- Measurement increases ΔZ  
  → decoherence and collapse  
- Low-energy projection of ΔZ reproduces Heisenberg uncertainty

This unifies:

- Heisenberg relation  
- decoherence  
- measurement problem  
- classical limit  

into one geometric principle.

# Z+17.5 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{FFT: Uncertainty originates in Z-depth (focus length).}
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{QM: Uncertainty appears as Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2 because we see only XY.}
}
\]

Thus:

- Z-axis spread → projection noise → Heisenberg uncertainty  
- Decoherence = ΔZ growth  
- Classical limit = ΔZ suppressed  
- Wave-particle duality = C-wave projection with variable Z  

Heisenberg uncertainty is therefore not fundamental but  
a **low-energy shadow of deeper FFT geometry.**
