## Decoherence as Loss of Focus:  
### ΔZ Growth Caused by Time-Layer Separation  
*(The Focus-Length Model of FFT)*

Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) identifies the Z-axis as the **direction of causal
depth**, formed by continuous accumulation of microscopic time-phase τ.
This accumulation is driven by atomic-scale oscillations with base frequency
ω₀′.  
Thus:

\[
Z \;\sim\; \omega_0' \, t,
\]

which means that **Z is literally “stacked time.”**

From this viewpoint, quantum decoherence is no longer mysterious:
it is simply the result of **focus mismatch** caused by the divergence of Z-depth.

In other words:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = \textbf{loss of focus in Z} 
}
\]

or mathematically:

\[
\boxed{
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
}
\]

## Z+16.1 Why Z-Axis = Focus Length

The observable world (perception, interference) lives on the XY-plane.
However, every physical system has a hidden Z-depth:

- the amount of past causal accumulation,
- encoded in the microscopic oscillation phase τ,
- governed by ω₀′ (atomic clock scale).

Thus Z works exactly like **optical focus**:

- Small ΔZ → same focal depth → waves overlap → **interference occurs**
- Large ΔZ → different focal depths → waves fail to overlap → **interference vanishes**

This simple geometric condition is the origin of coherence.

## Z+16.2 Why Decoherence Is Inevitable in Microscopic Observation

Microscopic observation (probing electrons, photons, etc.) requires resolving
extremely fine τ-structure:

- femtosecond time differences,
- atomic-scale phase noise,
- environmental χδ fluctuations.

Because Z is time-layered, even an infinitesimal phase difference:

\[
\delta \tau \sim 10^{-15}\,\mathrm{s}
\]

produces a **macroscopically significant change in Z**, due to accumulation:

\[
\delta Z = \omega_0' \, \delta \tau.
\]

Thus:

> At the microscopic scale, **focus alignment is almost impossible to maintain.**  
> This is the physical origin of decoherence.

## Z+16.3 Formal Definition of ΔZ (Focus Spread)

For a 3D density ρ:

\[
\Delta Z(t)
=
\sqrt{\langle Z^2\rangle - \langle Z\rangle^2},
\]

representing how much “focal depth” a system occupies.

- ΔZ ≈ 0 → focal match → quantum coherence  
- ΔZ grows → focal mismatch → decoherence

## Z+16.4 Why ΔZ Always Increases Under Environmental Contact

The generator field ψ obeys Sora dynamics:

\[
\partial_t\psi
=
\omega_0'
+ D\Delta\psi
+ \kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2
+ \xi,
\]

where ξ represents environmental phase noise.

This noise changes τ locally:

\[
\tau(t) \to \tau(t) + \delta\tau(t),
\]

which changes Z:

\[
Z(t) \to Z(t) + \delta Z(t).
\]

Since these fluctuations are uncorrelated across the system, the variance ΔZ
must increase:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z > 0.
\]

This is a direct result of diffusion-like spreading in causal depth.

## Z+16.5 Interference Collapse = Loss of Focal Overlap

Interference requires:

\[
\Delta Z < Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
\]

where \( Z_{\mathrm{coh}} \) is the coherence focus length.

Once:

\[
\Delta Z \ge Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
\]

the phases no longer align in XY projection, and:

- interference fringes disappear,
- density matrix off-diagonal terms vanish,
- ψ-wave collapses into a single branch.

This is decoherence in FFT.

---

## Z+16.6 Entanglement Decay Is the Same Mechanism

Two entangled particles A and B share the **same Z-depth**:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB}(0) = 0.
\]

But if A interacts with the environment:

\[
Z_A \to Z_A + \delta Z_A,
\]

then:

\[
\Delta Z_{AB} = |Z_A - Z_B| > 0.
\]

When this exceeds coherence range, entanglement disappears.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Entanglement death} = \text{focus mismatch in } Z.
}
\]

---

## Z+16.7 Physical Interpretation

We arrive at a remarkably simple picture:

> **Quantum states are coherent only when their Z-depth (focus length) is aligned.**  
> **Observation or environmental contact changes this focus length.**  
> **Therefore decoherence is inevitable, and entirely geometric.**

This replaces abstract “collapse” with intuitive optical-like focus geometry.

---

## Z+16.8 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = 
\textbf{growth of Z-axis focus spread }(\Delta Z)
}
\]

with key implications:

- Z = stacked time (atomic frequency) → extremely sensitive  
- Any environmental noise → τ shift → Z shift  
- Therefore ΔZ increases monotonically  
- Coherence disappears when focal overlap is lost  
- Entanglement is destroyed by differential Z-shift  

Thus FFT provides a **geometric, intuitive, and physically grounded** model of
decoherence, without invoking mysterious measurement axioms.
