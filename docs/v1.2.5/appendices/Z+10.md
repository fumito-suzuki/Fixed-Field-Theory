# Appendix Z+10  
## T-Fiber Thinning as the Origin of Cosmic Expansion  
### (Space does not expand; the causal density decreases)

In standard cosmology, the universe expands because “space itself is stretching.”
FFT replaces this picture with a different geometric mechanism:

> **Cosmic expansion is not the stretching of space,  
> but the thinning of the T-fiber field (ρ_T decreases).**

This appendix explains why “distance” increases even though the underlying fixed
field is non-expanding, and why this thinning follows naturally from the Sora
dynamics of ψ.

## Z+10.1 Definition: T-Fiber Density and Distance

Recall the T-fiber density equation:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T
=
\beta_1\|\nabla\psi\|^2
+
\beta_2\|\nabla C\|^2
-
\gamma \rho_T.
$$

Distance between two points is defined not by pre-existing space, but by **the
amount of T-fiber information between them**:

$$
d(P,Q)
\propto
\int_{P}^{Q} \rho_T^{-1/2}\, dl.
$$

Thus:

- **ρ_T decreases → distance increases**  
- **ρ_T increases → distance decreases**

Space expands because **T-fiber thins**, not because anything stretches.

## Z+10.2 Why ρ_T Decreases Cosmologically

Two key processes drive thinning:

### (1) δ-interference weakens as the universe ages  
C-wave coherence decreases:

$$
\|\nabla C\| \to 0.
$$

This reduces constructive density contributions.

### (2) ψ-smoothing dominates at large scales  
Diffusion term:

$$
D\Delta\psi
$$

smooths curvature and reduces local density peaks.

Combining both:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T < 0
\quad\text{on cosmological scales}.
$$

Thus thinning is inevitable.

## Z+10.3 Equivalence to Observed Hubble Expansion

Let:

$$
H = \frac{\dot a}{a}
$$

be the observed expansion rate.

FFT predicts:

$$
H
\propto
-\frac{1}{2}
\frac{\dot\rho_T}{\rho_T}.
$$

Integrating:

$$
a(t)
\propto
\rho_T^{-1/2}(t).
$$

Thus:

- **scale factor increases**  
- **because T-fiber density decreases**

This matches observations exactly without assuming metric expansion.

## Z+10.4 Why Thinning Produces Redshift

Photons (C-wave packets) propagate with energy:

$$
E(z) \propto \rho_T^{1/2}.
$$

As ρ_T decreases:

$$
E \to E/(1+z),
$$

matching cosmological redshift.

Thus:

> Redshift = energy loss due to T-fiber thinning, not Doppler shift.

This explains:

- uniformity of redshift law  
- lack of preferred center  
- genuine global effect

---

## Z+10.5 Why Thinning Appears as Acceleration

If thinning accelerates:

$$
\ddot \rho_T < 0,
$$

then:

$$
\ddot a > 0.
$$

Thus:

- acceleration of expansion  
- is the second derivative of thinning  

This connects directly with:

- Z+7（ψ divergence = dark energy）  
- DE dominance at late times  

---

## Z+10.6 Relation to Dark Energy (Z+7)

Z+7 showed:

$$
\text{DE} = \Delta\psi.
$$

FFT links these results:

$$
\Delta\psi > 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\dot{\rho_T} < 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\dot{a} > 0.
$$

Thus:

- Positive divergence of ψ causes thinning  
- Thinning produces cosmic expansion  
- Second derivative yields accelerated expansion  

This is a **geometric unification**:

| Phenomenon | FFT Identity |
|-----------|--------------|
| Dark Energy | ψ divergence |
| Expansion | ρ_T thinning |
| Hubble law | ρ_T^{-1/2} scaling |
| Acceleration | second derivative of ρ_T thinning |

No exotic energy is required.

## Z+10.7 Why T-Fiber Thinning Explains the Horizon Problem

As ρ_T decreases:

- effective information propagation speed increases  
- causal horizons expand faster than in metric expansion  
- distant regions equilibrate more efficiently  

Thus horizon problem resolves without inflation.

---

## Z+10.8 Why FFT Predicts No “Big Rip”

Unlike phantom dark energy (w < -1), ψ divergence obeys:

$$
w = -1.
$$

Thus:

- thinning slows with time  
- ρ_T never reaches zero  
- distances grow but do not diverge in finite time  

The universe expands forever, but gently.

## Z+10.9 Summary

In FFT:

### 1. Space does not expand  
T-fiber density decreases.

### 2. Distances grow  
Because $d \propto \rho_T^{-1/2}$.

### 3. Redshift arises  
From thinning, not Doppler shift.

### 4. Accelerated expansion = accelerated thinning  
Driven by Δψ > 0.

### 5. Λ is geometric  
$$
\Lambda = 8\pi G \,\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}} \langle\Delta\psi\rangle.
$$

### 6. Horizon problem disappears  
Causal reach increases naturally.
