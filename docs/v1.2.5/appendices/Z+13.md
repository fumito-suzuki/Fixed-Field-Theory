# Appendix Z+13  
## Quantum Teleportation as Z-Index Switching  
### (Reconstruction of XY Images through Z-Depth Reassignment)

In standard quantum mechanics, quantum teleportation is interpreted as
“state transfer without physical transmission.”  
In FFT, the phenomenon has a far simpler and fully geometric explanation:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Teleportation = Switching the Z-depth that generates the XY projection.}
}
$$

This mechanism is analogous to alternating between the left and right eyes:
the world appears to “shift” even though nothing physically moved.

# Z+13.1 Observation in FFT: Two Surfaces from One Projection

In FFT, perception is not 3D.  
It is **2.5D**:

- We observe only the **XY-plane**.  
- Depth is inferred from the **Z-axis alignment** of T-wave + C-wave contacts.  
- ψ is the generated geometry from χδ.

Thus, the observed reality is:

$$
\text{Observed world} = \Pi_{XY}[\psi(x,y,Z)].
$$

Different Z-levels generate different ψ-surfaces:

$$
\psi_Z(x,y) \neq \psi_{Z'}(x,y).
$$

Switching Z produces a different “visible world.”

# Z+13.2 Entanglement Prepares Shared Z-Depth

Before teleportation can occur, two systems A and B must share the same Z-depth:

$$
Z_A = Z_B.
$$

This is the entangled condition (see Z+15).

This means:

- A と B は同一の Z-index を持つ  
- XYへの投影は互いに干渉可能  
- 情報は Z 方向の区別がつかないため“共有されている”  

この状態で始める。

# Z+13.3 Teleportation Step = Z-Index Reassignment

In the teleportation protocol:

1. A interacts with system C  
2. This creates a new χδ-pattern at A  
3. The global Z-index assignment shifts:

$$
Z_B \leftarrow Z_A
$$

even though B may be far away.

Thus the ψ-surface at B becomes:

$$
\psi_B(x,y) = \psi_A(x,y)
$$

even though **no wave traveled**.

This is not “state transfer” but:

> \textbf{XY image reconstruction using another Z-depth.}

# Z+13.4 The Blink Model

When you close the left eye and open the right eye, the world “moves.”

When you rapidly alternate:

- nothing moves in the external world  
- the observed XY image switches  
- because the depth reconstruction (Z-index) switches

Quantum teleportation follows the same rule:

$$
\text{A measures C}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\text{Z-index realigns}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\text{B's XY-image becomes A's.}
$$

Thus:

> **teleported information = new Z-depth assignment**

not physical transfer.

# Z+13.5 Why No Classical Signal Is Required

Observers detect **only XY projections**.  
They cannot access Z-depth directly.

Thus, when the Z-index of B silently changes:

- XY image instantly changes  
- no signal is required  
- no information is transmitted faster than light  
- but the *projection* appears to update nonlocally

This resolves the “spooky action” paradox:

$$
\text{nonlocality} = \text{Z-axis geometry} \to \text{XY misinterpretation}.
$$

# Z+13.6 Measurement and Collapse in the Blink Model

Measurement adds environmental χ:

$$
\chi_A \to \chi_A + \delta\chi.
$$

This perturbs:

$$
Z_A \to Z_A + \delta Z.
$$

Thus teleportation is destroyed unless B is reassigned:

$$
Z_B \leftarrow Z_A.
$$

If not reassigned:

$$
\psi_A \neq \psi_B
$$

→ entanglement collapses  
→ teleportation fails  

Everything depends on Z-depth consistency.

# Z+13.7 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Teleportation = Switching Z-depth to reconstruct XY geometry elsewhere.}
}
$$

- No physical signal is transmitted  
- No wave travels  
- No object moves  

Instead:

- Z-depth is reassigned  
- XY-image is regenerated  
- ψ-surface appears to “jump”

Quantum teleportation is thus a **perceptual-geometric switching process**,  
entirely consistent with the tri-layer structure:

- T-wave = receptor  
- C-wave = information  
- ψ = visible geometry
