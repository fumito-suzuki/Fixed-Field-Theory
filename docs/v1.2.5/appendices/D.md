# Appendix D — Methodological Closure and Falsifiability in χδ Geometry  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix formalizes the **methodological closure** of Fixed-Field Theory
(FFT) within the χδ–ψ framework.

It does not introduce new dynamics or observables.
Instead, it clarifies:

- why FFT is **closed by construction**,
- how **computable models** arise from geometric restriction,
- how **falsifiability** is defined under projection-limited observation,
- why quantities such as particle number and current are **not fundamental**.

Its purpose is to prevent category errors between:

- geometric theory,
- restricted models,
- and projection-limited measurements.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

FFT is founded on the χδ principle:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

Within this framework:

- χ encodes causal curvature and irreversible Z-history,
- δ encodes interference density on delayed projection planes,
- ψ is the generated phenomenon at χ–δ contact,
- τ is emergent phase-time,
- observation is governed by projection $f$ and reconstruction
  $$
  G = f^\dagger f.
  $$

The theory explicitly separates:

- **ontology** (χ, δ, T-fiber),
- **appearance** (ψ),
- **observation** (projection-limited data).

This separation fixes the methodological structure of FFT.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Closure by Construction

FFT is closed at the geometric level.
Its foundational elements are:

- χ (causal curvature),
- δ (interference density),
- ψ (generated appearance),
- τ (phase-time),
- projection operator $f$,
- reconstruction operator $G$.

No additional interaction terms are required.
All observable structure arises from χδ coupling and projection.

### 3.2 Why Particle Number and Current Are Not Fundamental

FFT does not introduce particle number $N$ or current $J$ as primitives.

This follows directly from χδ geometry:

- multiplicity emerges from stabilized ψ-structures,
- flux and current emerge from τ-ordering and projection geometry,
- introducing $N$ or $J$ as fundamental would reintroduce particle ontology
  and continuity assumptions excluded by construction.

Thus FFT is closed by **geometric consistency**, not by summation of quantities.

### 3.3 Theory Versus Model

FFT distinguishes strictly between:

- **theory** — defining allowed geometric structures,
- **models** — selecting boundary conditions, kernels, and scales.

A model specifies:

- projection kernel $K$,
- symmetry assumptions,
- scale cutoffs,
- boundary conditions.

Only models are computable.
This mirrors the structure of General Relativity and quantum field theory.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Methodological constraints in FFT follow directly from χδ roles:

- χ is not directly observable and cannot be falsified independently,
- δ is observable only through projection,
- ψ is generated locally and does not propagate.

Therefore:

- determinism holds at the χ level,
- probability arises from projection-induced degeneracy,
- computability is conditional on geometric restriction.

These are not philosophical choices but consequences of χδ geometry.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix fixes the correct reading of the main text:

- **Section 3 (Irreversibility)**  
  irreversibility arises from Z-history writing in χ.

- **Section 4 (Observation)**  
  observation is projection and ψ-generation, not an act of a subject.

- **Section 5 (Quantum Phenomena)**  
  quantum statistics arise from projection geometry, not axioms.

- **Section 6 (Cosmology)**  
  large-scale structure emerges from coarse-grained χδ curvature.

- **Section 7 (Consciousness)**  
  consciousness, if modeled, interacts with χ-selection geometry, not ψ as
  substance.

Misinterpreting FFT as particle-based breaks consistency across these sections.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.1** — formal constraints on projection operator $f$,
- **8.2** — reconstruction operator $G$ and χ-band structure,
- **8.6** — computability under geometric restriction,
- **8.9** — falsifiability under projection-limited observation,
- **8.10** — conditions for observer-independent measurement.

These open problems concern implementation, not completion of the theory.

## 7. Summary

Fixed-Field Theory is:

- geometrically closed by χδ construction,
- computationally model-dependent,
- falsifiable through projection-consistent observables,
- free from unnecessary particle ontology.

FFT does not omit particle number $N$ or current $J$.

It demonstrates **why they are not fundamental** within χδ geometry.
