# Appendix Z+11 — Why Constant-τ Surfaces Are Spheres

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix proves a central geometric result of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT):

**Any surface of constant phase-time $\tau$, as perceived by an observer, is
necessarily a sphere centered on that observer.**

This result explains:

- why objects appear spherical,
- why depth is perceived isotropically,
- why camera images reproduce radial distortion,
- why the back side of objects is not visible,
- why the observable universe appears spherical around every observer.

The result is geometric, not optical, and arises from Z-axis delay in the
T-fiber field $\Psi$.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, time is not a global coordinate.
Observation is governed by **phase-time $\tau$**, generated by stable oscillation
of the generator field $\psi$.

The generator field satisfies:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

For perception, the relevant quantity is the Z-axis propagation delay of C-waves
through the T-fiber.

This delay defines the temporal order in which contributions to the observable
field $C$ become available.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Phase-Time as Z-Delay

The phase-time associated with depth is defined as:

$$
\tau_Z(x,y,z) = \frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}},
$$

where $c_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective propagation speed of C-waves in the
T-fiber.

Depth is therefore not a spatial coordinate but a **temporal offset**.

### 3.2 Definition of an Equal-τ Surface

An observer perceives as simultaneous all points satisfying:

$$
\tau(x,y,z) = \tau_0.
$$

The observable field is produced by the projection operator:

$$
C = f(\Psi) =
\mathcal{I} \circ (\Pi_{XZ}, \Pi_{YZ}).
$$

Only contributions whose delay lies within the perceptual integration window
are stabilized by interference.
Thus the perceived surface satisfies:

$$
\tau_Z(x,y,z) = \tau_0.
$$

### 3.3 Solving the Constant-τ Condition

In the underlying T-fiber geometry, define the radial coordinate:

$$
r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.
$$

Propagation in FFT obeys a radial delay relation:

$$
\tau = \frac{r}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}}.
$$

Setting $\tau = \tau_0$ gives:

$$
r = c_{\mathrm{eff}}\tau_0.
$$

Substitution yields:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 =
(c_{\mathrm{eff}}\tau_0)^2.
$$

This is the equation of a sphere centered on the observer.

Therefore, any constant-$\tau$ surface is spherical.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The result follows directly from χδ geometry:

- χ fixes causal depth and delay,
- δ enables interference-based stabilization,
- $\psi$ determines which τ-fronts are perceptually realized.

Because τ is defined by propagation delay, isotropy in delay implies isotropy
in perceived depth.

This also ensures consistency with the mass-density relation:

$$
\rho_T \propto \|\nabla\psi\|^2.
$$

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix fixes interpretations used throughout the main text:

- **Section 4 (Perception):** depth arises from τ-delay, not spatial extension.
- **Section 6 (Cosmology):** the observable universe forms a spherical horizon.
- **Section 3 (Irreversibility):** front-most τ-surfaces dominate perception.
- **Section 5 (Quantum limit):** projection suppresses deeper τ contributions.

The spherical structure is a necessary consequence of τ-based observation.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This result is required for:

- **8.1** — rigorous definition of the projection operator $f$,
- **8.3** — interpretation of observational dimensionality,
- **8.9** — mathematical foundation of phase-time $\tau$,
- **8.10** — observer-centered reconstruction of geometry.

## 7. Summary

We have shown that:

$$
\tau = \text{constant}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2.
$$

Thus:

- all perceptually stable surfaces are spherical,
- depth radiates isotropically from the observer,
- the observable universe is necessarily spherical,
- opacity and perspective follow from τ-front dominance,
- perception is fundamentally 2.5D, not truly 3D.

In Fixed-Field Theory, spherical appearance is not an illusion.
It is a **geometric necessity imposed by phase-time propagation**.
