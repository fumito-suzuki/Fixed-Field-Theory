# Appendix Z+16  
## Decoherence as Zχ-Divergence  
### (Loss of Quantum Coherence by Causal-Depth Dispersion)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), decoherence is not a stochastic collapse,  
nor an abstract loss of phase information.

It is a **geometric and deterministic process**:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} \;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\textbf{divergence of causal depth } Z_\chi.
}
$$

This appendix formalizes decoherence as the **spreading of χτ-accumulated
causal depth**, and clearly separates it from observational delay effects
(Z_obs).

## Z+16.1 Two Depths Recalled: Zχ vs Z_obs

Before defining decoherence, we restate the essential separation.

### (1) Zχ — causal depth (ontic)

- Defined on the **T-wave (χ)**  
- Accumulates irreversible interaction history  
- Exists independently of observation  
- Determines coherence and entanglement  

$$
Z_\chi = \int \omega_0' \, dt + \sum \Delta Z_\chi^{(\text{interaction})}
$$

---

### (2) Z_obs — observational depth (epistemic)

- Appears only through **projection**  
- Encodes arrival-time structure of C-waves  
- Depends on geometry and propagation  
- Cannot influence coherence itself  

$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \sim \tau_{\text{arrival}}
$$

**Decoherence is governed exclusively by Zχ.**

---

## Z+16.2 Definition of Decoherence in FFT

Let a system initially satisfy:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \approx 0.
$$

This corresponds to:

- well-defined χτ history  
- stable ψ-generation  
- quantum-coherent behavior  

Decoherence occurs when:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d}{dt}\,\Delta Z_\chi > 0.
}
$$

That is:

> **the causal depth of the system begins to spread.**

No reference to observers, measurement postulates, or probability is required.

## Z+16.3 Physical Origin: Environmental χ-Contact

Decoherence is caused by **unavoidable χ-interactions** with the environment.

Examples:

- collisions with air molecules  
- thermal vibrations of surrounding matter  
- electromagnetic contact via receptors  
- boundary constraints and mechanical coupling  

Each interaction contributes:

$$
\chi \rightarrow \chi + \delta\chi,
\qquad
Z_\chi \rightarrow Z_\chi + \delta Z_\chi.
$$

Because environments are complex:

- interactions are not identical  
- χ-updates are distributed  
- Zχ necessarily spreads  

This spreading is **monotonic and irreversible**.

---

## Z+16.4 Why C-Waves Alone Do Not Cause Decoherence

A crucial point:

> **C-waves do not carry χ.**

C-waves:

- are directional interference patterns  
- propagate independently of causal curvature  
- require a **T-wave receptor** to become an observation  

Thus:

- a passing C-wave without absorption  
  → no χ-update  
  → no Zχ change  
- information without contact  
  → no decoherence  

Decoherence begins **only when C-wave is received by matter**, i.e., when
χ-interaction occurs.

## Z+16.5 Measurement as Forced Zχ-Divergence

Measurement is not special; it is simply **strong environmental coupling**.

During measurement:

- many χ-channels interact simultaneously  
- δ-patterns collapse locally  
- ψ-generation becomes environment-dependent  

Formally:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \;\uparrow\; \text{rapidly}.
$$

This rapid Zχ divergence destroys:

- phase coherence  
- entanglement (Z+15)  
- interference visibility  

This is what is traditionally called *wavefunction collapse*.

---

## Z+16.6 Relation to Z+13 and Z+15

### With Z+15 (Entanglement)

- Entanglement requires:
  $$
  Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}.
  $$
- Decoherence breaks this equality:
  $$
  |Z_{\chi,A} - Z_{\chi,B}| > 0.
  $$

Thus:

> **Decoherence = entanglement decay.**

---

### With Z+13 (Teleportation)

- Teleportation operates on **Z_obs (arrival structure)**  
- Decoherence destroys **Zχ alignment**, not Z_obs  

Thus teleportation **fails** once decoherence occurs, even if arrival-time
information is available.

---

## Z+16.7 Why Decoherence Appears Probabilistic

Observers cannot access Zχ directly.

They observe only:

- projected XY patterns  
- delayed arrival (Z_obs)  
- ψ-surfaces reconstructed at receptors  

Because Zχ dispersion is hidden:

- outcomes appear random  
- probabilities emerge  
- Born rule is approximated  

In FFT, probability reflects **ignorance of Zχ**, not fundamental randomness.

---

## Z+16.8 Classical Limit

In macroscopic systems:

- χ-interactions are continuous  
- Zχ spreads extremely fast  
- coherence length shrinks to zero  

Thus:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \gg Z_{\text{coh}}
$$

always holds, yielding:

- stable classical trajectories  
- no observable interference  
- deterministic macroscopic behavior  

Classical physics is therefore the **high-decoherence limit of FFT**.

---

## Z+16.9 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = \textbf{irreversible divergence of } Z_\chi
}
$$

- Caused by environmental χ-interactions  
- Independent of observers or consciousness  
- Requires T-wave contact  
- Destroys entanglement and interference  
- Explains collapse, classicality, and irreversibility  

FFT thus replaces probabilistic collapse with a **geometric inevitability**:
the spreading of causal depth in a connected universe.
