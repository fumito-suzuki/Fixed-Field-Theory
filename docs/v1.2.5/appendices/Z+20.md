# Appendix Z+20 — Neutrino Oscillation as δ-Density Drift  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a **geometric reinterpretation of neutrino oscillation**
within Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

Its purpose is to show that neutrino oscillation:

- is **not** a superposition of mass eigenstates,
- does **not** require particle flavor mixing,
- arises naturally from **slow drift of δ-interference density**
  during long-distance C-wave propagation.

In FFT, neutrinos are

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{ultra-low-density C-waves whose δ-structure drifts under background geometry.}
}
$$

Thus, oscillation reflects **δ-density evolution**, not particle identity change.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

From Appendix Z+19, neutrinos satisfy:

- $\chi \approx 0$,
- $\delta \ll 1$,
- $\psi \approx 0$.

They therefore propagate nearly rectilinearly, with minimal τ-distortion and
almost no ψ-generation.

However, δ is **not strictly constant** during propagation.
It is weakly influenced by:

- large-scale gravitational potentials,
- global T-field density,
- background C-wave baths,
- ambient matter distributions.

This slow evolution of δ underlies neutrino oscillation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 δ as the Flavor Coordinate

In FFT, neutrino “flavors” correspond to **stable δ-bands**, not particles.

Formally,

$$
\nu_e  \leftrightarrow \delta_1,
\qquad
\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \delta_2,
\qquad
\nu_\tau \leftrightarrow \delta_3.
$$

A neutrino is therefore characterized by an **initial δ-spectrum**, not by a
definite flavor.

Propagation reshapes this spectrum, while detection selects the δ-band most
compatible with the local T-wave environment.

### 3.2 Adiabatic Drift of δ During Propagation

Along a propagation path $s$, δ evolves according to weak environmental coupling:

$$
\frac{d\delta}{ds} =
-\alpha\,\delta +
\beta\,\Delta_{\mathrm{env}},
$$

where:

- $\alpha$ represents natural smoothing of C-wave structure,
- $\beta$ measures environmental coupling strength,
- $\Delta_{\mathrm{env}}$ encodes δ-contrast of the surrounding T-field.

The solution is

$$
\delta(s) =
\delta_0\,e^{-\alpha s} +
\beta
\int_0^s
\Delta_{\mathrm{env}}(u)\,
e^{-\alpha (s-u)}
\,du.
$$

Because $\Delta_{\mathrm{env}}$ varies with cosmic structure, δ acquires
**quasi-periodic modulation**.

This modulation is conventionally interpreted as flavor oscillation.

### 3.3 Detection as δ-Profile Selection

A detector registers an event only when ψ is generated:

$$
\psi_{\mathrm{det}} =
\chi_{\mathrm{matter}}\,\delta.
$$

The interaction strength differs among δ-bands because detector matter has a
specific χ-profile.

Thus detection probability satisfies

$$
P(\delta \rightarrow \delta_i)
\propto
\|\chi_{\mathrm{det}}\|^2 \,\delta_i^2.
$$

This reproduces:

- flavor appearance and disappearance,
- baseline-length dependence,
- energy dependence,
- detector-material dependence,

without invoking mass mixing.

### 3.4 Origin of the Oscillation Frequency

The effective oscillation frequency arises from geometric effects:

- background T-wave curvature variations,
- large-scale C-wave baths,
- accumulated τ-phase delays.

An effective scale is

$$
\omega_{\mathrm{osc}}
\sim
\frac{\partial (\Delta Z)}{\partial s},
$$

since τ-delay governs the stability of δ-structure.

Oscillation frequency is therefore **geometric**, not dynamical in the particle
sense.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

Within χδ geometry:

- χ controls causal accumulation,
- δ controls observational interference,
- ψ marks the threshold of observability.

Neutrinos reside in the **δ-minimal regime**, where ψ-generation is rare but
δ-structure can still evolve slowly.

Oscillation reflects δ-geometry under long-range propagation through the
T-field.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies that:

- neutrino oscillation requires no mass eigenstates,
- flavor is an environmental selection effect,
- MSW-like resonances arise from δ-band matching,
- coherence is preserved because χ-coupling is negligible.

Standard oscillation phenomenology is therefore recovered as a geometric limit
of FFT.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.2** — classification of δ-band stability,
- **8.5** — long-range C-wave coherence,
- **8.8** — cosmological propagation of low-δ modes,
- **8.11** — geometric origin of oscillation frequencies.

## 7. Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Neutrino oscillation} = \textbf{δ-density drift during C-wave propagation.}
}
$$

This framework explains:

- apparent flavor mixing,
- baseline and energy dependence,
- environmental resonance effects,
- coherence over cosmic distances,

without invoking:

- mass eigenstates,
- mixing matrices,
- flavor superpositions,
- wavefunction collapse.

Neutrinos are simply **C-waves whose δ-structure slowly deforms** as they travel
through the T-field universe.
