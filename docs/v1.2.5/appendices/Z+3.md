# Appendix Z+3 — Projection Operator *f* and the Geometry of 2.5D Perception

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides additional mathematical and conceptual structure
supporting **Section N** of the main text, which discusses perception within
Fixed-Field Theory.

It addresses the following goals:

- clarify why perception is not an inverse reconstruction of 3D geometry
- derive the projection operator mapping T-fiber geometry to perceptual space
- connect χ, δ, ψ, and τ to apparent depth formation
- extend the results of Section N to a formal 2.5D perceptual model

---

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

Within Fixed-Field Theory, the relevant quantities are:

- χ — causal curvature injection  
- δ — interference density  
- ψ = χδ — information-gradient field  
- τ — phase-time generated by interference stability  

The main text states that:

> *Human perception does not recover three-dimensional structure, but stabilizes
> a lower-dimensional representation through interference delays.*

This appendix formalizes and expands that statement by introducing an explicit
projection operator acting on the T-fiber field.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Setup

Define the fields:

- ψ(x,y,z,t) — generator field  
- Ψ(x,y,z,t) — T-fiber geometry  
- ρ(x,y,z,t) — effective density field  
- C(x,y,t) — perceptual field  

The perceptual field lacks an independent Z-axis and encodes depth implicitly
through phase delay.

---

### 3.2 Key Equations

The generator field satisfies  
`ψ = χ δ`.

Let the T-fiber geometry be represented by  
`Ψ(x,y,z,t)`.

Define two Z-dependent projections:

- XZ-plane projection: `Π_XZ[Ψ]`  
- YZ-plane projection: `Π_YZ[Ψ]`

Introduce the Z-axis delay  
`τ_Z = z / c_eff`  
where `c_eff` is the effective C-wave propagation velocity.

The perceptual field is defined by  
`C = f(Ψ)`.

The projection operator takes the form  

`C(x,y,t) = 𝓘( Π_XZ[Ψ(·, t − τ_Z)], Π_YZ[Ψ(·, t − τ_Z)] )`.

Equivalently,  

`f = 𝓘 ∘ (Π_XZ, Π_YZ)`.

The operator is nonlinear, phase-sensitive, and explicitly Z-delay dependent.

---

### 3.3 Result

The interference operator is given by  

`𝓘(A,B)(x,y,t) = ∫ dz A(x,z,t − τ_Z) B(y,z,t − τ_Z) K(z)`,

where `K(z)` is a depth-weighting kernel that:

- peaks at the interference minimum  
- suppresses unstable depth contributions  
- ensures perceptual stability  

A minimal example is  

`K(z) = exp(−α z²)`,

though FFT does not assume Gaussianity. The kernel shape determines perceptual
characteristics across observers or species.

This construction yields a perceptual space with effective dimensionality  

`dim_eff = 2 + ε`,  
with `ε ≈ 0.5`.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The results support the χδ geometry of FFT as follows:

- χ injects causal curvature along the Z-axis  
- δ controls interference density between projections  
- ψ gradients determine perceptual stability  
- τ appears as a measurable Z-delay  

The effective mass-density relation  

`ρ_T ∝ ‖∇ψ‖²`

remains consistent with the projection-based perceptual model.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines Section **N** by clarifying:

- why depth is experienced rather than reconstructed  
- why perceptual geometry is neither fully 2D nor fully 3D  
- why objects appear opaque without invoking photon absorption  
- why classical optical reconstruction fails to describe perception  

Specifically:

> These results demonstrate that the phenomenon described in Section N
> is a direct consequence of the χδ interaction under Z-delay boundary
> conditions.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to the following open problems:

- **8.X** — the origin of perceptual dimensionality  
- **8.Y** — the role of τ in observation and stabilization  

This keeps Appendix Z+3 integrated with ongoing FFT development.

## 7. Summary

Key points:

- perception is a projection, not inverse reconstruction  
- depth originates from Z-axis phase delay τ  
- the operator `f` is interference-based and nonlinear  
- perceptual space has effective dimension 2.5  

This appendix extends the χδ–ψ geometry of FFT and provides a precise
mathematical foundation for the perceptual model introduced in Section N.
