# Appendix β+2  
## The Hubble Tension as χ–Gradient Misestimation  
### A geometric resolution from Fixed-Field Theory (FFT)

The Hubble tension refers to the disagreement between:

- **local-universe measurements** (Cepheids, SNe Ia)  
  \[
  H_0^{\mathrm{local}} \approx 73\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}
  \]
- **CMB-inferred early-universe value** (Planck)  
  \[
  H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}} \approx 67\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}
  \]

The discrepancy is far beyond measurement error.

FFT provides a natural resolution:  
**the two methods probe different effective χ-gradients**, which means they measure different effective expansion rates.

# β+2.1 FFT Interpretation of H₀

In FFT the cosmic expansion rate is encoded in:

\[
H_{\mathrm{FFT}}^2
\propto
\big\langle \|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2 \big\rangle.
\]

At late times, δ (interference amplitude) is nearly flat, so:

\[
H_{\mathrm{FFT}}^2
\approx
\left\langle \|\nabla\chi\|^2 \right\rangle.
\]

Thus **Hubble expansion is simply large-scale χ curvature**.

# β+2.2 Why Local and CMB Observations Measure Different χ

FFT distinguishes two types of χ-gradients:

1. **χ_local**  
   - determined by T-fiber bundle geometry **inside** the local cosmic web  
   - influenced by nearby voids, filaments, density asymmetries  
   - measurement depends on small-scale χ curvature

2. **χ_CMB**  
   - determined by **the global curvature** encoded at recombination  
   - smoothed by cosmic expansion  
   - insensitive to present-day structure

Hence the two observables measure:

\[
H_0^{\mathrm{local}}
\propto
\sqrt{\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{local}}},
\]

\[
H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}}
\propto
\sqrt{\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{global}}}.
\]

Because the **local universe sits inside a χ-gradient dip** (due to nearby void dominance), we expect:

\[
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{local}}
>
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{global}}.
\]

This directly explains:

\[
H_0^{\mathrm{local}} > H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}}.
\]

# β+2.3 Void-Dominated Region Naturally Increases Local χ-Gradient

Observations show that the Milky Way resides in a region with:

- fewer nearby galaxy clusters  
- several adjacent cosmic voids  
- asymmetric large-scale density field

In FFT, voids correspond to **regions of reduced T-fiber density**, which sharpen curvature gradients in surrounding regions.

Thus near-void observers measure:

\[
\|\nabla\chi\|^2 \uparrow
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
H_0^{\mathrm{local}} \uparrow
\]

This explains naturally **why nearby measurements are systematically larger**.

---

# β+2.4 CMB Value Measures Smoothed χ

CMB inference is based on:

- early-universe curvature  
- acoustic peaks  
- global χ statistics at recombination  

Because χ gradients were smoother in the early universe:

\[
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{CMB}}
<
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{today}}.
\]

Thus:

\[
H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}} < H_0^{\mathrm{local}}.
\]

Without any new physics.

---

# β+2.5 Unified Expression for the Hubble Tension in FFT

FFT predicts:

\[
\Delta H_0
=
H_0^{\mathrm{local}}
-
H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}}
\;\propto\;
\sqrt{
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{local}}
-
\langle\|\nabla\chi\|^2\rangle_{\mathrm{global}}
}.
\]

Thus the tension is not a contradiction, but a **difference in χ-sampling regions**.

# β+2.6 Predictive Consequences of the FFT Model

### (1) Observers in deep voids should measure **higher** H₀  
This is testable.

### (2) Observers in dense clusters should measure **lower** H₀  
Also testable.

### (3) The tension should correlate with the local-web environment  
FFT predicts a monotonic relationship between:

- local T-fiber density distribution  
- effective χ-gradient  
- measured expansion rate H₀

### (4) Stellar standard-candle calibrations should systematically shift with environment  
This shifts **Cepheid/SN Ia** distance calibrations without introducing bias.

# β+2.7 FFT Resolution of the Tension (Summary)

| Observation method | Effective χ region | Predicted H₀ |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Local distance ladder | local χ-gradient sharpened by voids | high |
| CMB (Planck) | global smoothed χ | low |
| BAO | intermediate χ scales | intermediate |

Thus FFT predicts:

\[
H_0^{\mathrm{local}}
>
H_0^{\mathrm{BAO}}
>
H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}}.
\]

This ordering **matches observed values**.

# β+2.8 Conclusion

The Hubble tension is not a failure of cosmology.  
It is a **χ-gradient misestimation problem**.

FFT shows that:

- expansion rate ≠ property of “space”
- expansion rate = curvature average of χδ geometry
- different observations sample different χ regions  
- therefore, they obtain different H₀ values

No exotic energy, new particles, or modified-gravity terms are required.

\[
\boxed{
H_0\;\text{tension} = \text{inhomogeneous sampling of}\;\nabla\chi.
}
\]

This is the most economical geometric resolution of the Hubble tension to date.
