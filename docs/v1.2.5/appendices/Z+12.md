# Appendix Z+12  
## Physical Observables of the C-wave in FFT  
### (T-wave / C-wave / ψ-geometry and What Each Can Reveal)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), all phenomena relevant to observation are organized
into three **distinct but interacting layers**.  
Crucially, **only two of them are physical wave-like entities**.

1. **T-wave (T-fiber)** — matter itself and its causal persistence  
2. **C-wave** — electromagnetic / interference waves (information carriers)  
3. **ψ (appearance geometry)** — χδ-generated observable geometry  
   *(not a wave, not a field, but a generated phenomenon)*

This appendix clarifies **what can be physically observed from the C-wave**, and
how this differs fundamentally from T-wave observables and ψ-generated
appearance.

## Z+12.1 Three Layers of Reality in FFT

FFT strictly separates **ontic structure** from **appearance**.

### (1) T-wave (T-fiber, matter layer)

**Definition.**  
The T-wave represents the continuous causal structure of matter along the Z-axis.
It is the *ontological substrate* of reality.

Properties:

- continuous and persistent  
- non-refractive  
- does not require observation to exist  
- includes atoms, molecules, solids, fluids, gases  
- includes biological receptors themselves  
- supports mechanical vibration and thermal motion  

Examples of T-wave phenomena:

- sound (pressure propagation in matter)  
- vibration  
- temperature  
- chemical bonding and reactions  

T-wave **exists regardless of observation**.

---

### (2) C-wave (interference / information layer)

**Definition.**  
A C-wave is any interference-based wave that becomes part of experienced reality
*only when interacting with a T-wave receptor*.

Examples:

- visible light  
- infrared radiation  
- radio and microwave signals  
- X-rays and γ-rays  

Properties:

- directional  
- refracted and absorbed  
- frequency-dependent  
- cannot be experienced without material interaction  

C-wave is **information**, not substance.

---

### (3) ψ — χδ-generated appearance geometry (not a wave)

A critical clarification:

> **ψ is not a wave.  
> ψ is not a physical field.  
> ψ is a generated appearance geometry.**

ψ is defined by:

$$
\psi = \chi\,\delta.
$$

Meaning:

- χ (T-wave curvature) supplies causal weight  
- δ (C-wave interference density) supplies pattern  
- ψ is the *observable geometry* generated at their intersection  

ψ determines:

- edges and contours  
- surface shape  
- shadow geometry  
- apparent depth  
- perceptual stability  

ψ does **not propagate** and has no independent existence.

## Z+12.2 Operational Definition of a C-wave

In FFT, a **C-wave** is defined operationally as:

> *An interference wave that becomes an event only through interaction with
> matter (T-wave).*

Examples:

- photons striking a retina  
- IR radiation detected by a sensor  
- radio waves received by an antenna  
- X-rays recorded on a detector  

Without T-wave interaction, C-waves remain **unrealized interference patterns**
within the fixed field.

---

## Z+12.3 Physically Observable Quantities of the C-wave

The C-wave admits a **restricted and well-defined set of observables**.

---

### (1) Intensity (amplitude squared)

$$
I(x,y,t) = |C(x,y,t)|^2.
$$

Observed as:

- brightness  
- radiation flux  
- signal power  
- exposure dose  

All detectors measure **|C|²**, never C directly.

---

### (2) Frequency and spectrum

$$
\omega_C,
\qquad
S(\omega_C) = |\hat C(\omega_C)|^2.
$$

Observed as:

- color  
- spectral lines  
- carrier frequencies  
- bandwidth  

This is the basis of spectroscopy and radio detection.

---

### (3) Spatial gradients and curvature

$$
\nabla C,
\qquad
\Delta C.
$$

Observed as:

- edges and contours  
- interference fringes  
- focusing / defocusing  
- caustics  

Biological vision and image processing systems explicitly compute these.

---

### (4) Relative phase (via interference)

$$
\phi_{12}
=
\arg\big(C_1^* C_2\big).
$$

Phase itself is not observed directly;  
**only interference outcomes** are observable.

Applications:

- interferometry  
- holography  
- VLBI radio astronomy

## Z+12.4 How T-wave and ψ Are Observed (by Contrast)

### (1) T-wave observables

T-wave observables correspond to **matter-level properties**:

- mass, position, momentum  
- mechanical vibration (sound)  
- temperature  
- chemical structure  

These exist independently of C-wave observation.

---

### (2) ψ observables (appearance geometry)

ψ is observed **only indirectly**, through how surfaces appear under C-wave
interaction.

Observable consequences:

- shape and contour  
- shading and shadow  
- texture and gloss  
- apparent depth and occlusion  

We never observe ψ itself—  
we observe **material surfaces whose appearance is governed by ψ**.

---

## Z+12.5 Why Observation Is Essential for C-waves

- T-wave (matter) exists without observation.  
- ψ (appearance geometry) constrains possible appearances.  
- **C-waves become facts only when absorbed or scattered by matter.**

Thus:

> Observation is not required for existence,  
> but is required for information to become history.

This resolves the observer paradox without invoking consciousness as a causal
agent.

---

## Z+12.6 Experimental Correspondence

FFT aligns exactly with known measurement practices:

| FFT quantity | Detectors |
|-------------|-----------|
| $|C|^2$ | CCD, CMOS, photomultipliers |
| $S(\omega_C)$ | spectrometers, radio receivers |
| $\nabla C$, $\Delta C$ | edge filters, vision systems |
| phase (via interference) | interferometers, holography |

No additional observables are predicted or required.

## Z+12.7 Summary

In Fixed-Field Theory:

- **T-wave (χ)** — matter and causal persistence  
- **C-wave (δ)** — electromagnetic / interference information  
- **ψ** — χδ-generated appearance geometry (not a wave)

The **physically observable quantities of the C-wave** are:

$$
\boxed{
\left\{
|C|^2,\;
\omega_C,\;
\nabla C,\;
\text{interference-derived phase}
\right\}
}
$$

These mediate between:

- ontic matter (T-wave), and  
- generated appearance (ψ),

forming the **information layer of the universe** in FFT.
