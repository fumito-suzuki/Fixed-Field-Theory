# Appendix Z+10 — T-Fiber Thinning as the Origin of Cosmic Expansion

*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix provides a geometric explanation of cosmic expansion in
Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

FFT does not interpret expansion as the stretching of space.
Instead, it identifies expansion as a consequence of **thinning of the
T-fiber field**, expressed as a decrease in T-fiber density $\rho_T$.

The purpose of this appendix is to:

- define distance in terms of T-fiber density,
- explain why $\rho_T$ decreases cosmologically,
- derive the Hubble law from T-fiber thinning,
- explain redshift and acceleration without metric expansion,
- connect cosmic expansion to ψ-dynamics and dark energy.

This appendix supports Sections 6 and 8 of the main text.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, spacetime is not a pre-existing geometric container.
All observable structure arises from χδ geometry and ψ-dynamics.

The generator field satisfies:

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

The T-fiber density $\rho_T$ evolves according to:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T =
\beta_1\|\nabla\psi\|^2 +
\beta_2\|\nabla C\|^2 -
\gamma \rho_T.
$$

Cosmic expansion is identified with the long-term behavior of this equation
under ψ-smoothing and interference decay.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Definition of Distance in FFT

Distance between two points is not defined by an underlying spatial metric.
It is defined by the amount of T-fiber information separating them.

The effective distance satisfies:

$$
d(P,Q)
\propto
\int_{P}^{Q}
\rho_T^{-1/2}\,dl.
$$

Consequently:

- decreasing $\rho_T$ increases distance,
- increasing $\rho_T$ decreases distance.

Thus expansion occurs even though the fixed field itself does not stretch.

### 3.2 Cosmological Thinning of the T-Fiber

Two large-scale processes drive thinning.

First, C-wave interference weakens over cosmic time, leading to:

$$
\|\nabla C\| \to 0.
$$

Second, ψ-dynamics is dominated by diffusion at large scales through the term
$D\Delta\psi$, which smooths curvature gradients.

Together these imply:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T < 0
\quad
\text{on cosmological scales}.
$$

T-fiber thinning is therefore unavoidable.

### 3.3 Emergence of the Hubble Law

Let the observed scale factor be $a(t)$, with expansion rate:

$$
H = \frac{\dot a}{a}.
$$

FFT predicts the relation:

$$
H
\propto
-\frac{1}{2}
\frac{\dot\rho_T}{\rho_T}.
$$

Integrating yields:

$$
a(t)
\propto
\rho_T^{-1/2}(t).
$$

Thus the observed Hubble expansion arises directly from the decrease of
T-fiber density.

### 3.4 Origin of Cosmological Redshift

C-wave packets propagate with energy scaling as:

$$
E
\propto
\rho_T^{1/2}.
$$

As $\rho_T$ decreases during propagation, observed energy decreases:

$$
E
\to
\frac{E}{1+z}.
$$

Redshift therefore arises from T-fiber thinning, not from Doppler motion or
metric stretching.

This explains the uniformity and isotropy of the redshift law.

### 3.5 Accelerated Expansion

If thinning accelerates:

$$
\ddot\rho_T < 0,
$$

then the scale factor satisfies:

$$
\ddot a > 0.
$$

Acceleration is therefore identified as the second derivative of T-fiber
thinning, not as the effect of an exotic energy component.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The thinning process is governed by ψ-dynamics.

Positive divergence of ψ satisfies:

$$
\Delta\psi > 0,
$$

which implies:

$$
\dot\rho_T < 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\dot a > 0.
$$

Thus:

- ψ divergence produces thinning,
- thinning produces expansion,
- accelerated thinning produces accelerated expansion.

This links cosmic expansion directly to χδ geometry.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix refines interpretations in the main text:

- **Section 6 (Cosmology):** expansion arises from density evolution, not metric growth.
- **Section 7 (Dark Energy):** ψ-divergence drives late-time acceleration.
- **Section 3 (Irreversibility):** thinning reflects irreversible χ-history smoothing.

No modification of general relativity is required at observational scales.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.5** — geometric derivation of the cosmological constant,
- **8.6** — mass and energy balance in the T-fiber,
- **8.7** — correspondence between FFT and GR,
- **8.9** — τ-time scaling and causal horizon structure.

## 7. Summary

In Fixed-Field Theory:

- space does not expand,
- T-fiber density $\rho_T$ decreases,
- distance scales as $\rho_T^{-1/2}$,
- redshift arises from thinning,
- acceleration is accelerated thinning,
- dark energy is ψ-driven geometry.

Cosmic expansion is therefore a manifestation of declining causal density,
not of stretching spacetime.
