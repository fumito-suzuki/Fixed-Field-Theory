## Quantum Teleportation as Z-Index Switching  
### (Reconstruction of Appearance Geometry via Z-Depth Reassignment)

In standard quantum mechanics, quantum teleportation is described as
“state transfer without physical transmission.”
In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), the same phenomenon admits a purely geometric and
non-mystical interpretation:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Teleportation = Reassignment of the Z-index that generates an XY appearance.}
}
$$

No object moves.
No wave propagates.
Only the **depth index responsible for appearance reconstruction** is switched.

## Z+13.1 Observation in FFT: Appearance Is 2.5D

In FFT, observation is fundamentally **not three-dimensional**.

- Only the **XY-plane** is directly observed.  
- Depth is encoded indirectly through **Z-axis alignment**.  
- ψ is the χδ-generated *appearance geometry*, not a physical field.

Thus, the observed world is:

$$
\text{Observed appearance}
=
\Pi_{XY}\big[\psi(x,y;Z)\big].
$$

Different Z-values generate different appearance geometries:

$$
\psi_Z(x,y) \neq \psi_{Z'}(x,y).
$$

Switching Z therefore switches the *visible world*.

## Z+13.2 Entanglement as Shared Z-Index

Before teleportation is possible, two systems A and B must share the same
Z-index:

$$
Z_A = Z_B.
$$

This is the entangled condition (see Appendix Z+15).

Meaning:

- A and B occupy the same Z-depth sector  
- their XY projections are mutually compatible  
- Z-distinction is inaccessible to observers  

Hence, the systems share a single appearance-generating depth.

## Z+13.3 Teleportation as Z-Index Reassignment

During the teleportation protocol:

1. System A locally interacts with system C  
2. A new χδ configuration is generated at A  
3. The global Z-index assignment is updated:

$$
Z_B \leftarrow Z_A.
$$

As a result:

$$
\psi_B(x,y) = \psi_A(x,y),
$$

even though no signal or object traveled between A and B.

Teleportation is therefore:

> **reconstruction of the same XY appearance using a reassigned Z-depth.**

## Z+13.4 The Blink Analogy (Intuitive Model)

When you alternate between left and right eyes:

- the external world does not move  
- the perceived image shifts slightly  
- because the **depth reconstruction reference** switches  

Quantum teleportation obeys the same principle:

$$
\text{Measurement at A}
\;\Rightarrow\;
\text{Z-index realignment}
\;\Rightarrow\;
\text{Appearance at B switches}.
$$

Nothing propagates.
Only the **reference depth for appearance** changes.

---

## Z+13.5 Why No Classical Signal Is Required

Observers have access only to **XY projections**.
The Z-index itself is unobservable.

Therefore:

- a Z-index reassignment produces an instantaneous change in appearance  
- no signal traverses space  
- no superluminal information transfer occurs  

The apparent nonlocality arises from:

$$
\text{Z-axis geometry}
\;\to\;
\text{misinterpretation in XY-only observation}.
$$

---

## Z+13.6 Measurement, Collapse, and Z-Consistency

Measurement introduces environmental curvature:

$$
\chi_A \to \chi_A + \delta\chi.
$$

This perturbs the Z-index:

$$
Z_A \to Z_A + \delta Z.
$$

Teleportation remains valid **only if**:

$$
Z_B \leftarrow Z_A
$$

is enforced.

Otherwise:

$$
\psi_A \neq \psi_B
$$

- appearance coherence breaks  
- entanglement collapses  
- teleportation fails  

All outcomes depend on **Z-index consistency**, not wave collapse.

---

## Z+13.7 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation = Z-index switching that regenerates appearance elsewhere.}
}
$$

- No physical signal is transmitted  
- No wave propagates  
- No object moves  

Instead:

- Z-depth is reassigned  
- XY appearance is reconstructed  
- ψ-geometry appears to “jump”  

Quantum teleportation is therefore a **geometric switching phenomenon**, fully
consistent with FFT’s tri-layer structure:

- **T-wave** — material substrate / receptor  
- **C-wave** — interference information  
- **ψ** — generated appearance geometry
