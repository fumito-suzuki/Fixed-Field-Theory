# Appendix Z+7  
## Dark Energy as ψ-Divergence  
### (Cosmic acceleration from the global expansion of the generator field)

This appendix explains dark energy (DE) in Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).  
In FFT, cosmic acceleration is not driven by a mysterious fluid or exotic form
of energy. Instead, it emerges from the **global divergence of the generator
field ψ**:

$$
\text{DE} = \nabla\cdot(\nabla\psi).
$$

Because ψ = χδ couples curvature (χ) with interference structure (δ), its global
drift naturally produces the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.

## Z+7.1 ψ as the Source of Cosmological Expansion

Recall the Sora equation:

$$
\partial_t \psi
=
\omega_0'
+ D\Delta\psi
+ \kappa\|\nabla\psi\|^2
+ \xi.
$$

The **key term** driving cosmic acceleration is:

$$
D\Delta \psi = D\,\nabla\cdot(\nabla\psi).
$$

This term acts as **diffusive expansion** of the generator field.  
If the mean value of Δψ is positive:

$$
\langle \Delta \psi \rangle > 0,
$$

then the T-fiber **globally expands**, producing the observed space expansion.

Thus:

> **Dark energy = positive divergence of ψ across cosmological scales.**

## Z+7.2 Definition: Dark Energy Density from ψ

Define:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}
\equiv
\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}}
\left\langle \Delta\psi \right\rangle_{\mathrm{cosmic}}.
$$

Where:

- average is over super-horizon scales  
- $\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}}$ is determined by GR/FFT matching  
- Δψ > 0 produces repulsive geometric curvature  

This behaves as dark energy with:

- uniform distribution  
- constant or slowly varying density  
- negative pressure (see below)  

---

## Z+7.3 Negative Pressure from ψ Divergence

In GR, dark energy obeys:

$$
p = -\rho.
$$

FFT reproduces this from ψ.

Pressure in FFT geometry is determined by the trace of curvature:

$$
p_{\mathrm{eff}}
= 
-\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}}
\langle \Delta\psi \rangle.
$$

Thus:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}
=
\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}}
\langle \Delta\psi \rangle
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
p_{\mathrm{DE}}
=
-\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}.
$$

This matches the cosmological constant equation of state exactly.

## Z+7.4 Derivation of the Cosmological Constant Λ

Appendix Z+5 introduced:

$$
\Lambda
=
\lambda_0 \left\langle \Delta\psi \right\rangle.
$$

Substituting the dark-energy definition above:

$$
\Lambda = 8\pi G \, \rho_{\mathrm{DE}}.
$$

Thus Λ is not a fundamental constant but a **derived geometric quantity**:

$$
\Lambda = 8\pi G\,\alpha_{\mathrm{DE}}
\left\langle \Delta\psi \right\rangle.
$$

Therefore:

> **The cosmological constant is the average Laplacian of ψ.**

This resolves the long-standing “fine-tuning problem” of Λ.

## Z+7.5 Why ψ Divergence Does Not Dilute with Expansion

Ordinary matter dilutes as:

$$
\rho_m \propto a^{-3}.
$$

Radiation dilutes faster:

$$
\rho_r \propto a^{-4}.
$$

But ψ divergence is tied to the **geometry**, not particle number.

Since:

- ψ is defined on the T-fiber,  
- and the T-fiber itself expands,  

the divergence does not dilute:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}
\approx \text{constant}.
$$

This reproduces the observationally supported ΛCDM behavior.

---

## Z+7.6 Why Dark Energy Dominates at Late Times

As the universe expands:

- δ interference weakens  
- χ curvature becomes diffuse  
- ψ gradients smooth out  
- Δψ becomes positive on average  

Thus:

$$
\rho_m \to 0,
\qquad
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}} \to \text{constant},
$$

so DE inevitably dominates.

This is an automatic prediction of FFT.

No tuning required.

## Z+7.7 FFT Explanation of Accelerated Expansion

GR (Appendix Z+21) gives:

$$
\ddot a > 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\rho + 3p < 0.
$$

FFT supplies:

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}} + 3p_{\mathrm{DE}}
=
\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}(1-3)
=
-2\rho_{\mathrm{DE}}
< 0.
$$

Thus the universe accelerates **because Δψ is positive**.

---

## Z+7.8 Connection to T-Fiber Geometry

The T-fiber density evolves as:

$$
\partial_t \rho_T
=
\beta_1\|\nabla\psi\|^2
+ \beta_2\|\nabla C\|^2
- \gamma\rho_T.
$$

As δ decays cosmologically:

- $\|\nabla C\|$ decreases  
- $\|\nabla\psi\|$ smooths  
- divergence term Δψ dominates  

The geometry expands uniformly:

$$
\partial_t (\text{T-fiber thickness})
\sim 
D \left\langle \Delta\psi \right\rangle
> 0.
$$

Acceleration = global relaxation of ψ curvature.

## Z+7.9 Comparison with Dark Matter (Z+6)

| Aspect | Dark Matter | Dark Energy |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Origin | χ-residual curvature | ψ divergence |
| Sign | attractive | repulsive |
| Spatial variation | halo-like | uniform |
| Effect | flat rotation curves | accelerated expansion |
| Visibility | invisible (δ=0) | geometric-only |
| Equation of state | cold | $w=-1$ |

DM and DE are unified as **two regimes of χδ geometry**:

- DM = curvature without projection  
- DE = expansion without curvature

## Z+7.10 Summary

Dark energy in FFT is not a fluid, scalar field, or vacuum fluctuation.  
It is a **geometric property** of the generator field ψ:

$$
\text{DE} = \Delta\psi.
$$

This naturally explains:

- the cosmological constant  
- constant DE density  
- negative pressure  
- late-time domination  
- accelerated expansion  

All without introducing new entities.
