# Appendix Z+15  
## Quantum Entanglement as Zχ-Alignment  
### (Separation of Causal Depth Zχ and Observational Depth Z_obs)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum entanglement is not a mysterious nonlocal
interaction.  
It is a **geometric condition of shared causal depth**, strictly defined on the
χ-side of the theory.

The central statement is:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} \;\Longleftrightarrow\; Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}.
}
$$

This appendix removes a common source of confusion by explicitly separating:

- **Zχ** — causal depth accumulated in the T-fiber (χτ domain)  
- **Z_obs** — apparent depth reconstructed in observation (XτZ / YτZ projection)

Only **Zχ** is relevant for entanglement.

## Z+15.1 Two Distinct Depths in FFT

FFT uses the symbol *Z* in two fundamentally different contexts.

### (1) Causal depth: Zχ  

- Defined on the **T-wave (χ)**  
- Encodes accumulated causal history (τ stacking)  
- Independent of observation  
- Not directly observable  
- Shared globally if systems are causally synchronized  

Formally:
$$
Z_\chi = \int \omega_0' \, dt + \Delta Z_\chi^{(\text{interaction})}.
$$

---

### (2) Observational depth: Z_obs  

- Appears only through **projection**  
- Encoded in delayed planes (XτZ / YτZ)  
- Depends on propagation path and receptor geometry  
- Manifests as “apparent distance” or “depth”  

Formally:
$$
Z_{\mathrm{obs}} \sim \tau_{\text{arrival}}.
$$

This depth exists **only for observers**.

---

## Z+15.2 Definition of Entanglement (FFT)

Two systems A and B are **entangled** iff:

$$
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}.
$$

Meaning:

- they share the same χτ accumulation  
- they occupy the same causal layer of the T-fiber  
- their ψ-generation remains mutually consistent  

No reference to spatial distance or observation is required.

This replaces the abstract Hilbert-space criterion with a geometric one.

---

## Z+15.3 Why Entanglement Appears Nonlocal

Observers have access **only to Z_obs**, not Zχ.

Thus:

- systems may be far apart in XY  
- signals arrive with different delays  
- but Zχ may still be identical  

This leads to the illusion of “instantaneous influence.”

Formally:
$$
Z_{\chi,A} = Z_{\chi,B}
\quad\text{while}\quad
Z_{\mathrm{obs},A} \neq Z_{\mathrm{obs},B}.
$$

The nonlocality paradox is therefore a **projection artifact**.

---

## Z+15.4 Measurement as Zχ-Divergence (Decoherence)

Measurement is an interaction with an environment E:

$$
\chi_A \rightarrow \chi_A + \delta\chi_E.
$$

This modifies causal accumulation:

$$
Z_{\chi,A} \rightarrow Z_{\chi,A} + \delta Z_\chi.
$$

Thus:

$$
|Z_{\chi,A} - Z_{\chi,B}| > 0.
$$

Once Zχ diverges beyond coherence tolerance:

- χδ no longer generates a shared ψ  
- interference collapses  
- entanglement is lost  

This is **decoherence**, not a mysterious collapse.

---

## Z+15.5 Relation to Z+13 (Teleportation as Arrival-Time Reassignment)

In Z+13, quantum teleportation is shown to be:

> **a reassignment of arrival-time structure (Z_obs), not transfer of substance.**

This is consistent because:

- entanglement resides in **Zχ**  
- teleportation operates on **Z_obs**  
- no causal depth is transmitted  

Thus:

- Zχ provides *eligibility* (shared layer)  
- Z_obs determines *where* ψ is reconstructed  

No contradiction arises.

---

## Z+15.6 Entanglement vs. Decoherence vs. Observation

| Phenomenon | Governing depth |
|-----------|----------------|
| Entanglement | Zχ (causal) |
| Teleportation | Z_obs (arrival-time) |
| Observation | Z_obs + receptor |
| Decoherence | divergence of Zχ |
| Collapse | loss of shared Zχ |

This table eliminates category errors common in QM interpretations.

---

## Z+15.7 Why No Faster-Than-Light Signal Exists

Because:

- Zχ is not transmissible  
- Z_obs differences reflect propagation delays  
- ψ is generated locally at receptors  

No information travels superluminally.

What appears “instantaneous” is simply **pre-existing Zχ alignment** revealed
by observation.

---

## Z+15.8 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} = \textbf{shared causal depth }(Z_\chi)
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Nonlocality} = \textbf{misinterpretation of } Z_{\mathrm{obs}}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence} = \textbf{divergence of } Z_\chi
}
$$

FFT therefore replaces quantum mystery with:

- explicit geometric layers  
- clear separation of causality and observation  
- and a physically intelligible mechanism for entanglement.
