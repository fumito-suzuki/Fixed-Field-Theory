## Quantum Entanglement as Shared χ-Depth  
### (Causal-Depth Identity Without Nonlocal Influence)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), quantum entanglement is not a nonlocal interaction
and does not require faster-than-light signaling.

Instead, entanglement is a **geometric remnant of wave branching** under a shared
causal history.

The defining condition is:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} \;\Longleftrightarrow\; Z_{\chi}^{(A)} = Z_{\chi}^{(B)}.
}
$$

Here $Z_\chi$ denotes **χ-depth (causal depth)**, not perceptual depth or arrival
delay.

## Z+15.1 Clarifying the Meaning of “Z” in Entanglement

FFT distinguishes three depth-related quantities:

- **$Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$** — perceptual depth in 2.5D observation (XτZ / YτZ)  
- **$\tau$** — C-wave arrival delay / phase-time  
- **$Z_\chi$** — accumulated causal depth from χ interactions  

This appendix uses **only $Z_\chi$**.

> Entanglement does **not** depend on perceptual depth or wave arrival time.

## Z+15.2 Origin of Entanglement: Wave Branching

Consider a single χδ-generated process producing a C-wave:

$$
\psi \;\Rightarrow\; C.
$$

When this wave encounters a branching interaction (e.g., beam splitter,
spin-separation process), the C-wave divides:

$$
C \;\longrightarrow\; C_A \oplus C_B.
$$

This branching occurs **after** a shared causal buildup of χ, so both branches
inherit the **same χ-depth**:

$$
Z_\chi^{(A)} = Z_\chi^{(B)}.
$$

This is the sole origin of entanglement in FFT.

> **Entanglement = common causal ancestry of wave branches.**

No additional mechanism is required.

## Z+15.3 Mathematical Expression of Shared χ-Depth

Define χ-depth as:

$$
Z_\chi
=
\int \chi(\psi)\, dt.
$$

For two branches A and B generated from the same χδ event:

$$
Z_\chi^{(A)} - Z_\chi^{(B)} = 0.
$$

As long as this condition holds, the ψ-generated outcomes remain statistically
correlated when projected onto XY.

This correlation is **not causal influence**, but shared geometry.

---

## Z+15.4 Why Entanglement Appears Nonlocal

Observers detect only XY projections:

$$
\Pi_{XY}(\psi).
$$

Because $Z_\chi$ is hidden, XY-only observers cannot distinguish:

- shared causal depth  
- from instantaneous influence  

Thus the appearance of “spooky action” arises from:

$$
\text{hidden } Z_\chi \;\longrightarrow\; \text{misinterpreted XY correlation}.
$$

There is no signal, no propagation, and no information transfer.

## Z+15.5 Measurement as χ-Depth Divergence (Decoherence)

When system A interacts with an environment E:

$$
\chi_A \;\longrightarrow\; \chi_A + \delta\chi,
$$

the χ-depth updates:

$$
Z_\chi^{(A)} \;\longrightarrow\; Z_\chi^{(A)} + \delta Z_\chi.
$$

If B does not undergo the same interaction:

$$
Z_\chi^{(A)} \neq Z_\chi^{(B)}.
$$

Once the mismatch exceeds the χ-coherence length $L_\chi$:

$$
|Z_\chi^{(A)} - Z_\chi^{(B)}| > L_\chi,
$$

the shared geometry is lost.

This is **entanglement collapse**, identical to decoherence.

---

## Z+15.6 Bell Correlations Without Nonlocality

Bell-type violations occur because:

- measurements are performed on branches that still share $Z_\chi$  
- choices affect χ locally but projections are compared globally  

FFT explains Bell correlations as:

> **statistics of wave branches sharing a hidden causal depth.**

No nonlocal update occurs.

---

## Z+15.7 Relation to Teleportation (Z+13)

To avoid confusion:

- **Entanglement (this appendix)**  
  → wave branching + shared $Z_\chi$
- **Teleportation (Z+13)**  
  → reassignment / arrival-time selection of wave contributions (τ-based)

They are distinct mechanisms and must not be conflated.

---

## Z+15.8 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Entanglement} = \textbf{shared χ-depth }(Z_\chi).
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Collapse / Decoherence} = \textbf{divergence of } Z_\chi.
}
$$

- No particles are transmitted  
- No signals propagate  
- No nonlocal force exists  

Quantum entanglement is a **geometric memory of common causal origin**, revealed
only because observers see projections onto XY and cannot access χ-depth
directly.
