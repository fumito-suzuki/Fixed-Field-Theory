# Appendix Z+22 — Curvature Cascade in χδ Geometry  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix develops the **multi-scale curvature cascade** implicit in the
χδ–ψ structure of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT).

Its purpose is to show how a single recursive mechanism connects:

- quantum-scale interference,
- mesoscopic curvature amplification,
- cosmic-scale geometry in the General Relativity (GR) limit.

Curvature propagation across scales is shown to arise naturally from χδ
geometry, without introducing additional fields or scale-dependent postulates.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In χδ geometry, curvature does not originate from mass as in GR.
Instead, it originates from **gradients of the generator field**:

$$
\mathcal{K} \propto \|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2.
$$

Both χ and δ are scale-free fractal fields.
As a result, the generator field

$$
\psi = \chi\delta
$$

inherits a recursive structure.

Curvature therefore propagates across scales through the loop:

$$
(\chi,\delta)
\;\longrightarrow\;
\psi
\;\longrightarrow\;
\mathcal{K}
\;\longrightarrow\;
(\chi',\delta').
$$

This loop is structurally identical at all scales, producing
self-similar curvature patterns.
This process is referred to as the **FFT curvature cascade**.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 Mathematical Kernel of the Cascade

Let the FFT operator acting on the T-fiber field $\Psi$ be

$$
\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{FFT}}\Psi
=
i\hbar \partial_t \Psi
+
D \Delta \Psi
+
\ell_D^{\,2-D} \Delta^{D} \Psi
-
\hat{\Sigma}[\Psi].
$$

Define the curvature density

$$
\rho_{\mathcal{K}}
=
\|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2.
$$

Under a scale transformation $r \rightarrow \lambda r$, the fractal Laplacian
satisfies

$$
\Delta^{D} f(\lambda r)
=
\lambda^{-D}
\Delta^{D} f(r).
$$

It follows that

$$
\rho_{\mathcal{K}}(\lambda r)
\sim
\lambda^{2-D}
\rho_{\mathcal{K}}(r).
$$

FFT therefore predicts a **power-law curvature cascade** in which:

- small-scale fluctuations with $D < 2$ amplify under coarse-graining,
- large-scale curvature compresses into filaments under fine-graining.

This structure is mathematically analogous to turbulence cascades, but is driven
by χδ geometry rather than fluid inertia.

### 3.2 Physical Interpretation Across Scales

#### Quantum Scale

At the quantum scale, C-wave interference δ fluctuates rapidly.
Small perturbations of ψ generate localized micro-curvature pockets:

$$
\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{q}}
\sim
\|\nabla\psi\|^2_{\mathrm{micro}}.
$$

These pockets act as curvature “seeds” for larger-scale structure.

#### Mesoscopic Scale

At mesoscopic scales, micro-curvature aggregates into coherent χ patterns.
Examples include:

- atomic shell structure,
- molecular geometry,
- dust-cloud density waves,
- magneto-acoustic patterns in plasma.

This regime corresponds to the transfer

$$
\delta_{\mathrm{micro}}
\longrightarrow
\chi_{\mathrm{meso}}.
$$

Here ψ-gradients become anisotropic, generating preferred curvature directions.

#### Cosmic Scale

At cosmological scales, the cascade produces:

- filamentary large-scale structure,
- void formation through δ-deficit,
- effective dark-matter curvature dominated by χ,
- accelerated expansion driven by global δ-drift.

At this scale, FFT curvature approximates the Einstein tensor:

$$
G_{\mu\nu}
\approx
\left\langle
\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu (\chi\delta)
\right\rangle_{\mathrm{coarse}}.
$$

General Relativity therefore appears as the **coarse-grained limit** of the
curvature cascade.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

The curvature cascade provides a unified interpretation of χδ roles:

- χ governs causal accumulation and curvature persistence,
- δ governs interference, fluctuation, and large-scale drift,
- ψ mediates curvature transfer across scales.

Different physical regimes correspond to different points in the cascade,
rather than to different fundamental laws.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix connects directly to prior FFT results.

### Relation to Z+11 (Dark Matter)

Dark matter corresponds to χ-dominant curvature regions:

$$
\delta \approx 0,
\qquad
\chi \neq 0.
$$

The cascade explains why such regions naturally cluster at mesoscopic and cosmic
scales.

### Relation to Z+10 (Dark Energy)

Dark energy corresponds to global δ-drift increasing causal depth:

$$
\partial_t \langle \delta \rangle > 0.
$$

The cascade explains why this drift appears homogeneous at large scales.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- **8.3** — scale-dependent curvature dynamics,
- **8.6** — emergence of GR from χδ microstructure,
- **8.10** — dark sector unification without particles,
- **8.12** — fractal geometry of the T-fiber field.

## 7. Summary

Define the scale-dependent curvature field

$$
\mathcal{K}(r) = \|\nabla(\chi\delta)\|^2_{r}.
$$

The curvature cascade obeys the recurrence

$$
\mathcal{K}(r_{n+1})
=
\lambda_n^{\,2-D}
\mathcal{K}(r_n)
+
\varepsilon_n,
$$

where $\lambda_n$ is the scale ratio and $\varepsilon_n$ represents C-wave
injection noise.

Key conclusions:

- quantum fluctuations act as curvature seeds,
- mesoscopic structures amplify curvature directionality,
- cosmic geometry is the coarse-grained limit of the cascade,
- dark matter and dark energy arise from distinct cascade regimes,
- General Relativity emerges from large-scale averaging of χδ curvature.

The curvature cascade enables FFT to unify

**quantum → astrophysical → cosmological physics**

within a single mathematical framework.
