## Quantum Teleportation as τ-Selection Switching  
### (ψ Reconstruction by Arrival-Time Reassignment, Not State Transfer)

In standard quantum mechanics, quantum teleportation is often described as
“state transfer without physical transmission.”
In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), the phenomenon admits a simpler and fully geometric
interpretation:

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation = switching which arrival-time } \tau
\textbf{ is adopted to generate } \psi.
}
\]

No matter, energy, or information is transported.
Only the **location where ψ is generated** changes.

## Z+13.1 Observables in FFT: ψ Appears Only on the XY Plane

In FFT, observers never access 3D reality directly.

- Observable space is the **XY projection plane**
- Depth is encoded only as **arrival-time delay τ**
- Particles are not objects but **generated appearances**

Formally:

\[
\text{Observed entity} = \psi(x,y;\tau).
\]

Different values of τ yield different ψ-surfaces:

\[
\psi(x,y;\tau_1) \neq \psi(x,y;\tau_2).
\]

There is no underlying particle trajectory in Z.

## Z+13.2 Entanglement as C-wave Branching (Preparation Stage)

Prior to teleportation, systems A and B share a **single emission event**
(C-label).

This means:

- A single C-wave expands across space
- Multiple observation points receive **branched wavefronts**
- No system possesses a unique ψ yet

Thus:

\[
\textbf{Entanglement = branching of a single C-wave, not shared depth.}
\]

This matches Appendix Z+15’s statement:
entanglement precedes ψ-generation.

## Z+13.3 Teleportation as τ-Adoption Switching

During the teleportation protocol:

1. A measurement is performed at site A  
2. This selects a specific arrival-time τ\_A  
3. The experimental constraint forces site B to adopt the same τ\_A  

As a result:

\[
\psi_B(x,y;\tau_A) = \psi_A(x,y;\tau_A),
\]

even though:

- no wave traveled from A to B
- no material entity moved
- no information propagated superluminally

What changed is only:

\[
\textbf{which delayed wavefront is used to generate } \psi.
\]

---

## Z+13.4 Blink Analogy (Corrected Interpretation)

Teleportation is analogous to selecting which eye’s image is used:

- Both images already exist as wavefronts
- No scene moves
- Switching the selection changes the perceived world

In FFT:

\[
\text{Measurement} \Rightarrow \text{τ-selection} \Rightarrow \psi\text{ appears elsewhere}.
\]

This is not motion, but **reconstruction**.

---

## Z+13.5 Why No Signal Is Required

Arrival-time τ is not an observable quantity.
Observers access only ψ on the XY plane.

Therefore:

- τ-selection can change globally
- ψ-generation appears instantaneous
- no usable signal is transmitted
- causality is not violated

Nonlocality arises from **projecting τ-structured reality onto XY-only access**.

---

## Z+13.6 Measurement and Failure of Teleportation

Environmental interaction at A perturbs χ and destabilizes τ-selection:

\[
\tau_A \rightarrow \tau_A + \delta\tau.
\]

If B cannot adopt the same τ:

\[
\psi_B(x,y;\tau_A) \neq \psi_A(x,y;\tau_A),
\]

then:

- ψ-surfaces decorrelate
- teleportation fails
- no paradox occurs

This is not collapse of a particle,
but **loss of synchronized ψ-generation**.

---

## Z+13.7 Summary

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Quantum teleportation = reassignment of arrival-time } \tau
\textbf{ used to generate } \psi.
}
\]

- Entanglement = C-wave branching from one emission
- Teleportation = τ-adoption switching
- Particle = ψ (generated appearance)
- No entity moves
- No information travels

Quantum teleportation in FFT is therefore a **geometric reconstruction
phenomenon**, not a transport process.
