# Appendix Z+11  
## Why Constant-τ Surfaces Are Spheres  
### (The Spherical Universe Theorem in FFT)

This appendix proves a central geometric result of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT):  
**any surface of constant phase-time τ, as perceived by an observer, is
necessarily a sphere centered on that observer.**

This result explains:

- Why planets appear spherical  
- Why we perceive depth isotropically  
- Why camera images reproduce radial distortion but not arbitrary shapes  
- Why nothing “behind” an object is visible  
- Why the observable universe appears as a sphere around every observer  

The result is not optical—it is geometric, arising from Z-axis delays in the
T-fiber field Ψ.

## Z+11.1 τ as a propagation delay, not a coordinate time

In FFT, time is not a global parameter but a **phase-time τ** defined by stable
oscillations of the generator field ψ:

$$
\tau(x,y,z) = \int \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(\psi) \, dt.
$$

For the purpose of perception, the relevant quantity is the **Z-axis propagation
delay**:

$$
\tau_Z(x,y,z) = \frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}},
$$

where $c_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective propagation speed of C-waves through
the T-fiber.  
This delay determines when a perceptual contribution from depth z becomes
available in the projected field $C(x,y,t)$.

Thus “depth” is not spatial distance but **time offset**.

## Z+11.2 Definition of the observed equal-τ surface

The observer perceives as simultaneous all points satisfying:

$$
\tau(x,y,z) = \tau_0.
$$

Projecting with the operator:

$$
C = f(\Psi) 
= \mathcal{I} \circ (\Pi_{XZ},\Pi_{YZ}),
$$

the observer experiences as a stable percept those points whose delay matches
the perceptual integration window.  
This is:

$$
\tau_Z(x,y,z) = \tau_0.
$$

We now show that this equation defines a sphere.

## Z+11.3 Derivation: Solving τ = constant

**In the underlying T-fiber geometry Ψ, prior to any projection,  
the effective radial coordinate is defined as follows:**

$$
r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.
$$

Given:

$$
\tau_Z = \frac{z}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}} = \tau_0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
z = c_{\mathrm{eff}} \tau_0.
$$

But for perception, the XY distance is not independent of z.  
The flattened-view geometry of FFT imposes a radial propagation structure in Ψ:

$$
\tau = \frac{r}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}}.
$$

Substituting:

$$
r = c_{\mathrm{eff}}\,\tau_0,
$$

we obtain:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2
= (c_{\mathrm{eff}}\,\tau_0)^2.
$$

This is precisely the equation of a sphere.

> **∴ Any constant-τ surface is a sphere centered at the observer.**

## Z+11.4 Physical meaning of the theorem

### Why objects appear spherical  

Whenever the C-wave contributions from Ψ arrive with the same delay τ, the
interference operator $ \mathcal{I} $ stabilizes them as a unified percept.
Because τ = constant defines a sphere, *anything perceived as unified appears
spherical*.

This is true even if the actual object is not spherical in Ψ.

This explains:

- faces  
- bowls  
- fruits  
- planets  
- iridescent highlights  
- specular reflections  

Spherical appearance is built into the geometry of perception.

## Z+11.5 Why the universe looks spherical around every observer

The same relation:

$$
\tau = \frac{r}{c_{\mathrm{eff}}}
$$

implies that the observable universe boundary (“particle horizon”) is a sphere:

$$
r_{\mathrm{horizon}} = c_{\mathrm{eff}} \tau_{\mathrm{universe}}.
$$

This is not due to expansion of optical light, but the geometrical structure of
the T-fiber itself and the propagation of C-waves.

Thus:

> Every observer necessarily sits at the center of a spherical observational shell.

This is an *artifact of perception*, not an anthropic coincidence.

## Z+11.6 Why we cannot see the “back side” of objects

If τ-fronts are spheres, then for any object:

- the nearest τ-front forms earlier and stabilizes  
- farther τ-fronts produce signals too delayed to interfere constructively  
- $ f(\Psi) $ suppresses all back-facing contributions  

Thus opacity is not “photon absorption” but **τ-front dominance**.

---

## Z+11.7 Why camera images obey the same rule

Any imaging system based on:

- wave propagation  
- finite integration windows  
- projection onto 2D sensors  

will produce equal-τ surfaces identical to human perception.

This explains why all cameras:

- see spheres  
- cannot see behind objects  
- exhibit perspective distortion directly derivable from τ geometry  

FFT thus unifies biological and optical perception.

## Z+11.8 Connection to Z+3: 2.5D Perception

The projection operator:

$$
f(\Psi)(x,y,t)
=
\int dz\; 
\Pi_{XZ}\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)
\Pi_{YZ}\Psi(\cdot,t-\tau_Z)
K(z),
$$

stabilizes percepts at **τ = constant**, but cannot resolve Z independently.
This yields effective dimensionality 2.5:

- two spatial axes  
- plus depth encoded as Z-delay, not spatial extent  

Thus:

> 2D + Z-delay = 2.5D perception.  
>  3D is never directly observed.

Constant-τ surfaces being spheres guarantees that “depth” always radiates
isotropically from the observer.

## Z+11.9 Summary

We have proven that:

$$
\tau = \text{constant}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2.
$$

This spherical geometry explains:

- the shape of the observable universe  
- spherical appearance of objects  
- opacity and perspective  
- 2.5D perception  
- the equivalence of biological and optical imaging  
- the absence of backside vision  

In FFT, spherical appearance is not an illusion—it is a **geometric necessity**.
