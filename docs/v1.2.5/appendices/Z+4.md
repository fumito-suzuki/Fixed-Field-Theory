# Appendix Z+4 — Low-Energy Quantum Limit of FFT  
*(Fixed-Field Theory v1.2.x Supplemental Material)*

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This appendix establishes the mathematical bridge between the **geometric
uncertainty relation** of Fixed-Field Theory (FFT) and the standard
**Heisenberg uncertainty relation** of quantum mechanics.

Its purpose is to demonstrate that quantum mechanics arises as the
**low-energy, low-curvature limit** of FFT through dimensional reduction
of T-fiber geometry.

No quantum postulates are assumed.
The uncertainty principle is derived geometrically.

## 2. Background (χδ–ψ Framework)

In FFT, observable geometry is obtained by projecting the full T-fiber field
$\Psi$ onto delayed XY planes.

The generator field is defined by

$$
\psi = \chi\delta.
$$

This projection:

- removes direct access to the Z-axis,
- preserves only interference information on XY,
- introduces an intrinsic loss of causal information.

As a result, FFT admits a **purely geometric uncertainty relation**
prior to any quantum interpretation.

## 3. Main Derivation / Model

### 3.1 FFT Geometric Uncertainty

The fundamental geometric uncertainty relation in FFT is

$$
\Delta_Z \cdot \Delta_{XY} \ge \Lambda_0.
$$

Here:

- $\Delta_Z$ measures hidden curvature spread along the Z-axis,
- $\Delta_{XY}$ measures spatial spread on the projected plane,
- $\Lambda_0$ is a geometric invariant determined by χδ coupling.

This relation reflects projection-induced information loss,
not quantum indeterminacy.

### 3.2 Z-Axis Curvature and Momentum Identification

Momentum in FFT is identified with the rate of Z-winding of emergent phase-time
$\tau$:

$$
p \propto \partial_Z \tau.
$$

Accordingly, momentum uncertainty satisfies

$$
\Delta p \propto \Delta(\partial_Z \tau),
$$

which can be expressed as

$$
\Delta p \approx \frac{\Delta_Z}{L_\tau},
$$

where $L_\tau$ is the characteristic scale of τ-variation.

### 3.3 Projection and Position Uncertainty

Projection onto the XY plane produces spatial blurring:

$$
\Delta x \sim \Delta_{XY}.
$$

This follows from the projection relation

$$
C(x,y,t) =
\int
\Psi(x,y,z,t-\tau_Z)\,
K(z)\,dz.
$$

Finite Z-resolution forces curvature spread in Z to appear as
position uncertainty in XY.

### 3.4 Reduction to the Heisenberg Relation

Substituting the geometric–physical identifications

$$
\Delta_Z \approx L_\tau \Delta p,
\qquad
\Delta_{XY} \approx \Delta x
$$

into the FFT bound yields

$$
(L_\tau \Delta p)(\Delta x) \ge \Lambda_0.
$$

This implies

$$
\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\Lambda_0}{L_\tau}.
$$

Defining the matching condition

$$
\frac{\Lambda_0}{L_\tau} = \frac{\hbar}{2},
$$

the Heisenberg uncertainty relation

$$
\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

emerges as the **low-energy projection** of the FFT geometric bound.

## 4. Relation to χδ Geometry

This reduction occurs when:

- χ-curvature is weak,
- δ-interference is stable,
- ψ behaves approximately linearly,
- τ becomes approximately classical.

In this regime:

- χδ coupling persists,
- but higher-order curvature effects are suppressed.

Quantum mechanics appears as the **flattened projection**
of χδ geometry.

## 5. Implications for Main Sections

This appendix clarifies:

- **Section 4 (Observation):**  
  uncertainty originates from projection geometry, not measurement disturbance.

- **Section 6 (Quantum Behavior):**  
  quantum mechanics is an emergent limit of curvature dynamics.

- **Section 7 (Decoherence):**  
  decoherence corresponds to Z-axis divergence and loss of χ-alignment.

## 6. Link to Open Problems (Section 8)

This appendix contributes to:

- geometric origins of quantum uncertainty,
- τ-linearization regimes,
- breakdown conditions of quantum mechanics at high curvature,
- connections between uncertainty and Z-depth growth.

These problems concern scale transition, not theory completion.

## 7. Summary

The quantum uncertainty principle is recovered in FFT by dimensional reduction:

$$
\Delta_Z \Delta_{XY}
\Longrightarrow
\Delta x \Delta p.
$$

Quantum mechanics is therefore the **low-energy effective theory**
of Fixed-Field Theory, not a fundamental description.

Uncertainty is geometric in origin and arises from projection-induced
information loss.
