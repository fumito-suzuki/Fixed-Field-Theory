## Decoherence as Zχ-Divergence  
### (Loss of Coherence via Causal-Depth Dispersion)

In Fixed-Field Theory (FFT), decoherence is not a probabilistic collapse,
nor a result of observation or consciousness.

It is a **geometric process**:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence = divergence of causal depth } Z_\chi.
}
$$

When the χ-field of a system interacts with an environment,
its accumulated causal depth can no longer remain sharply defined.
This Zχ-dispersion destroys coherence in ψ without requiring any observer.

## Z+16.1 Strict Separation of Depth Parameters

To avoid ambiguity, FFT distinguishes:

- **$Z_\chi$** — causal depth accumulated in χ  
  (ontic, irreversible, environment-sensitive)  
- **$Z_{\mathrm{obs}}$** — perceptual depth in 2.5D projection  
- **$\tau$** — C-wave arrival delay (phase-time)

This appendix concerns **only $Z_\chi$**.

> Decoherence is a χ-process, not a τ-process.

## Z+16.2 Definition of Zχ and Its Physical Meaning

The causal depth $Z_\chi$ is defined as:

$$
Z_\chi
=
\int \chi(\mathbf{r},t)\, dt,
$$

representing the **stacked causal history** of a system.

Properties:

- additive over time  
- irreversible  
- insensitive to spatial separation in XY  
- sensitive to environmental interaction  

When $Z_\chi$ is sharply defined, ψ remains coherent.

## Z+16.3 Environmental Interaction and Zχ Dispersion

Let a system S interact with an environment E.

Environmental contact modifies χ locally:

$$
\chi_S \;\rightarrow\; \chi_S + \delta\chi_E.
$$

Because environmental degrees of freedom are uncontrolled and numerous,
this leads to:

$$
Z_\chi \;\rightarrow\; Z_\chi + \delta Z_\chi(\omega),
$$

where $\omega$ labels microscopic interaction channels.

Thus, instead of a single value, the system acquires a **distribution**:

$$
P(Z_\chi),
\qquad
\text{with}\quad
\mathrm{Var}(Z_\chi) > 0.
$$

This spread is the geometric origin of decoherence.

---

## Z+16.4 Coherence Condition and Its Breakdown

ψ-coherence requires:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \ll Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
$$

where $Z_{\mathrm{coh}}$ is the χ-band coherence width.

As environmental coupling proceeds:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\Delta Z_\chi > 0.
$$

Once:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi \gtrsim Z_{\mathrm{coh}},
$$

the system can no longer sustain a single ψ-branch.

Interference terms vanish, and ψ appears classical.

## Z+16.5 Relation to Density Matrix Decoherence

In standard quantum mechanics:

$$
\rho \;\rightarrow\; \text{diagonalized } \rho,
$$

via environment-induced decoherence.

FFT identifies this as:

$$
\rho
=
\int dZ_\chi \; P(Z_\chi)\, \rho(Z_\chi).
$$

When $P(Z_\chi)$ broadens:

- off-diagonal ψ-interference averages to zero  
- effective classical mixture emerges  

No collapse postulate is required.

---

## Z+16.6 Why Decoherence Is Irreversible

Because $Z_\chi$:

- only increases in variance  
- cannot be globally re-aligned without reversing all environmental interactions  

we have:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\mathrm{Var}(Z_\chi) \ge 0.
$$

This establishes the **arrow of time** in FFT as:

> monotonic growth of Zχ dispersion.

Recoherence would require impossible global χ-phase reassembly.

---

## Z+16.7 Relation to Entanglement (Z+15)

Entanglement requires:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi^{AB} \approx 0.
$$

Environmental interaction with A yields:

$$
\Delta Z_\chi^{AB} \to \Delta Z_\chi^{AB} + \delta Z_\chi,
$$

breaking the Zχ-alignment.

Thus:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence = destruction of entanglement via Zχ divergence.}
}
$$

This unifies entanglement loss and decoherence geometrically.

---

## Z+16.8 Why Observation Is Not Required

Decoherence proceeds:

- in vacuum  
- in the dark  
- without detectors  
- without consciousness  

Any T-wave ↔ T-wave interaction contributes to χ-variation.

Observation is merely a **late-stage C-wave readout**, not the cause.

---

## Z+16.9 Summary

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Decoherence in FFT is Zχ divergence, not wavefunction collapse.}
}
$$

- χ accumulates causal history  
- environmental coupling disperses $Z_\chi$  
- ψ coherence fails when dispersion exceeds tolerance  
- irreversibility follows from monotonic Zχ variance growth  

Decoherence is therefore a **geometric inevitability**,  
fully determined by χ-field dynamics and independent of observers.
